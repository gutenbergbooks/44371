<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In offering this little book to the reader interested in
Bridgework, the author desires to express his acknowledgments
to the proprietors of &#8220;Engineering,&#8221; in which journal
the papers first appeared, for their courtesy in facilitating
the production in book form.</p>

<p>It may possibly happen that the scanning of these pages
will induce others to observe and collect information extending
our knowledge of this subject&mdash;information which,
while familiar to maintenance engineers of experience, has
not been so readily available as is desirable.</p>

<p>No theory which fails to stand the test of practical
working can maintain its claims to regard; the study of
the behaviour of old work has, therefore, a high educational
value, and tends to the occasional correction of views which
might otherwise be complacently retained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>

<p>No book has, so far as the author is aware, been written
upon that aspect of bridgework to be treated in the following
pages. No excuse need, therefore, be given for adding to
the already large amount of published matter dealing with
bridges. Indeed, as it too often happens that the designing
of such constructions, and their after-maintenance, are in
this country entirely separated, it cannot but be useful to
give such results of the behaviour of bridges, whether new
or old, as have come under observation.</p>

<p>In the early days of metallic bridges there was of necessity
no experience available to guide the engineer in his
endeavour to avoid objectionable features in design, and he
was, as a result, compelled to rely upon his own foresight
and judgment in any attempt to anticipate the effects of
those influences to which his work might later be subject.
How heavily handicapped he must have been under these
conditions is evident from the mass of information since
acquired by the experimental study of the behaviour of
metals under stress, and the growth of the literature of
bridgework during the last forty years. That many mistakes
were made is little occasion for surprise; rather is it a cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
for admiration that some very fine bridges, still in use, were
the product of that time. Much may be learned from the
study of defects and failures, even though they be of such a
character that no experienced designer would now furnish
like examples.</p>

<p>Modern instances may, none the less, be found, with
faults repeated, which should long since have disappeared
from all bridgework, and are only to be accounted for by
the unnatural divorce of design and maintenance already
referred to. As the reader proceeds, it may appear that
details are occasionally touched upon of a character altogether
too crude and objectionable to need comment; but the
consideration of these cases is none the less interesting, and,
so far as the author&#8217;s observation goes, not altogether unnecessary.</p>

<p>Most of the instances cited are of bridges, or parts of
bridges, of quite small dimensions; but it is these which
most commonly give trouble, both because the effects of impact
are in such cases most severely felt, and possibly because
the smaller class of bridges is very generally designed by men
of less experience, than large and imposing structures.</p>

<p>The particulars given relate in all cases to bridges of
wrought iron, unless otherwise described.</p>

<p>An endeavour has been made to secure some kind of
order in dealing with the subject, but it has been found
difficult to avoid a somewhat disjointed treatment, inseparable,
perhaps, from the nature of the matter. Finally,
the reader may be assured that every case quoted has come
under the writer&#8217;s personal notice.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Girder Bearings.</span></h3>

<p>In girder-work generally, and more particularly in plate-girders,
considerable latitude obtains in the amount of bearing
allowed. Clearly, the surface over which the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
is distributed should be sufficiently ample to avoid overloading
and possible crushing or fracture of bedstones where
these exist; but if no knuckles are introduced, this is an
extremely difficult matter to insure. A long bearing may
deliver the load at the extreme end of the surface on which
it rests, or, more probably, near the face.</p>

<p>If the girder is made with truly level bearings, and the
beds set level, it will certainly, when under load, throw an
extreme pressure upon that part of the bearing surface
immediately under the forward edge of the bearing-plate.
These considerations probably account for bedstones frequently
cracking, in addition to which possibility there is
the disadvantage that the designer does not know where the
girder will rest, and cannot truly define the span. The
variation of flange-stress due to this cause may, in a girder
of ordinary proportions, having bearings equal in length to
the girder&#8217;s depth, be as much as 15 per cent. above or
below that intended.</p>

<p>If great care be taken in setting beds, in the first instance,
to dip toward the centre of the span an amount depending
upon the anticipated girder deflection, it may be possible to
insure that when under full load the girder bearing shall
rest equally upon its seat; but this is evidently a difficult
condition to obtain practically, is good only for one degree of
loading, and may at any time be nullified by a disturbance
of the supports, as, for instance, the very common occurrence
of a slight leaning forward of abutment walls.</p>

<p>Double or treble thicknesses of hair-felt are sometimes
placed beneath girder bearings, with the object of securing
a better distribution of pressure, no doubt with advantage;
but this practice, though it may be quite satisfactory as
applied to girders carrying an unchangeable load, hardly
meets the case for loads which are variable. Notwithstanding
the faulty nature of the plain bearing ordinarily used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
for girders of moderate span, its extreme simplicity commends
it to most engineers. It must be admitted that no serious
inconvenience need be anticipated in the majority of cases,
particularly if the bearings are limited in length, do not
approach nearer than 3 inches to the face of bedstones, and

</div>

<p>Whether with long or short bearings, the forward edge
should be at right angles to the girder&#8217;s length. In skew
bridges it is sometimes seen that this edge follows the angle
of skew. The effect on the girder is to twist it, as will be
clear from a little consideration. In evidence of this the
case may be quoted of a lattice girder of 95 feet effective
span and 7 feet deep, which, resting on a skew abutment
right up to the masonry face at a rather bad angle (about
15 degrees), was, after twenty years, found canted over at
the top to the extent of 4 inches, with the further result of
springing a joint in the top flange at about the middle of
the girder, causing some rivets to loosen. The bedstone
was also very badly broken at the face, and had to be
replaced in the course of repairs (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>). This girder had,
in addition to the canting from the upright position at its
end, and the distortion of the top flange, a curvature in the
same direction, though less in amount, at the bottom&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
effect very common in the main girders of skew bridges, and
possibly accounted for in part by a tendency of the girder
end to creep along the abutment away from the point at
which it bears hardest, under frequent applications and
removals of the live load, and accompanying deflections.</p>

<p>This tendency to travel may be aggravated in bridges
carrying a ballasted road, in which there may be a considerable
thickness of ballast near the bearings, by the compacting
and spreading of this material taking effect upon the
girder end, tending to push it outwards, being tied only by
a few light cross-girders badly placed for useful effect.
The movement may be prevented in new work for moderate
angles of skew by carrying the end cross-girders well back,
and securing them in some efficient manner; or by the
introduction of a diagonal tie following the skew face, and
attached to cross and main girder flanges (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>)&mdash;a method
which may be applied to existing work also.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a>
<img src="images/illo017.png" alt="" width="350" height="232" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.</p>
</div>

<p>For such a case as that cited it is imperative that ballast
pressure at the girder end should be altogether eliminated.</p>

<p>The fixing of girder ends by bolts&mdash;a practice at one
time usual&mdash;hardly calls for remark, as it is now seldom
resorted to unless for special reasons; but it may be well to
point out the weakening effect of holes for any purpose in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
bedstones. Bed-plates commonly need no fixing; the weight
carried keeps them in position, or if, in the case of very
light girders upon separate plates, it is considered well to
secure these from shifting, it may best be done by letting
the plate in bodily a small amount, or by means of a very
shallow feather sunk into a chase.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig3" id="Fig3"></a>
<img src="images/illo018.png" alt="" width="450" height="298" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.</p>
</div>

<p>As an improvement upon the plain bearing usually
adopted, it is an easy matter so to design girder-ends as to
deliver the load by a narrow strip of bearing-plate carried
across the bottom flange, distributing the pressure upon the
stone, if there be one, by means of a simple rectangular plate
of sufficient stoutness (<a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>). An imperfect knuckle will
by this means result, with freedom to slide, and the girder
span be defined within narrow limits. A true knuckle is, of
course, the best means of securing imposition of the load
always in the same place; but this by itself is not sufficient
where the girder is of a length to make temperature and
stress variations important, in which case rollers, or freedom
to slide, become necessary. Bridges exist in which roller-bearings
have been adopted without the knuckle, or its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
equivalent, but this is wholly indefensible, as it is obvious
that the forward roller will in all probability take the whole
load, and cannot be expected to keep its shape and roll freely
under this mal-treatment. It is sometimes asserted that
rollers are never effective after some years&#8217; use; that they
become clogged with dirt, and refuse to perform their office.</p>

<p>There is no reason why rollers should not be boxed in to
exclude dirt by a casing easily removed, some attention being
given to them, and any possible accumulation of dirt removed
each time the bridge is painted.</p>

<p>To test the behaviour of rollers under somewhat unfavourable
conditions for their proper action&mdash;that of the
bearings of main roof trusses of crescent form, 190 feet span&mdash;the
author, some thirty years since, took occasion to make
the necessary observations, and found evidence of a moderate
roller movement, though there was in this case no direct
horizontal member to communicate motion. With girders
resting upon columns, particularly if of cast iron, a roller
and knuckle arrangement is most desirable for any but very
small spans, as, if not adopted, the result will be a canting
of the columns from side to side&mdash;a very small amount, it is
true, but sufficient to throw the load upon the extreme edges
of the base, though the knuckle alone will relieve the top of
this danger. The author at one time took the trouble to
examine, so far as it could be done superficially and without
opening out the ground to make a complete inspection
possible, a number of bridges crossing streets, in which
girders rested upon and were secured to cast-iron columns
standing in the line of kerb; and he found cracks, either at
the top or bottom, in about one of every four columns.</p>

<p>When girders passing over columns are not continuous,
it may be difficult to find room for a double roller and
knuckle arrangement; but this inconvenience may be overcome
by carrying one girder-end wholly across the column-top,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and securing the next girder-end to it in a manner
which a little care and ingenuity will render satisfactory,
one free bearing then serving to carry the load from both
girders.</p>

<p>Though the wisdom of using rollers is apparent in spans
exceeding some moderate length, say 80 feet&mdash;as to which
engineers do not seem quite decided&mdash;and varying with the
conditions, it need not be overlooked that in some cases
masonry will be sufficiently accommodating to render them
unnecessary; piers, if sufficiently tall and slender, will
yield a small amount without injury, and though shorter, if
resting upon a bottom not absolutely rigid, will rock and
give the necessary relief; but it is obvious, if the resistance
to movement is sufficiently great, and the girder cannot slide
or roll on its bearings, bedstones will probably loosen, as,
indeed, frequently happens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">MAIN GIRDERS; PLATE-WEBS.</span></h2>

<p>It is seldom that girders of this description&mdash;or, indeed, of
any other&mdash;show signs of failure from mere defect of strength
in the principal parts, even though somewhat highly stressed;
and instances tending to support this statement will be given
in a later chapter. For the present, it is proposed to indicate
peculiarities of behaviour only, generally, but not always,
harmless.</p>

<p>Though now less often done, it was at one time common
practice to load plate-girders on the bottom flange by simply
resting floor timbers, rails, troughs, or cross-girders upon
them. In outside girders one result of this is to cause the
top flange to take a curve in plan, convex towards the road,
every time the live load comes upon the floor of the bridge,
upon the passing of which the flange resumes its figure, though
still affected by that part of the load which is constant.</p>

<p>A bridge of 47 feet span, carrying two lines of way,
having one centre and two outside girders, with a floor consisting
of old Barlow rails, resting upon the bottom flanges,
showed the peculiarity named in a marked degree.</p>

<p>The outside girders, under dead load only, were, as to
the top flanges (see <a href="#Fig4">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#Fig5">5</a>), 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch
respectively out of straight in their length, but upon the
passing of a goods engine and train curved an additional 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
inch, or 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches in all, for one outside girder, and 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>
inches for the other.</p>

<p>The centre girder, having a broader and heavier top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
flange, curved <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch towards whichever road might be
loaded. The effect of such horizontal
flexure is clearly to induce stresses of
tension and compression in the flanges,
which, being (for the top flange) compounded
with the normal compressive
stress due to load carried, results in a
considerable want of uniformity across
the section.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a>
<img src="images/illo022.png" alt="" width="600" height="149" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4.</p>
</div>

<p>In the case under notice, the writer
estimates the stresses for an outer
girder top flange at 4&middot;5 tons per
square inch compression for simple
loading, and 5&middot;5 tons per square inch
of tension and compression, on the
inner and outer edges, due to flexure,
resulting when compounded in a stress
of 1 ton per square inch tension on
the inside, and 10 tons per square inch
compression on the outside edge. In
this rather extreme case the stress on
the inner edge, or that nearest the
load, is reversed in character.</p>

<p>The effect described appears to be
not wholly due to the twisting moment.
It is apparent that whatever curvature
may be induced by twisting alone
must be aggravated in the compression
flange by its being put out of line.</p>

<p>The writer does not attempt here to
apportion the two effects in any other
way than to say that the greater part
of the flexure appears to be due to the secondary cause. Consistent
with this view of the matter is the fact that the inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the girder towards the rails greatly exceeded the
calculated slope of the Barlow rail-ends when under load,
being about five times as great. The inference is that the
floor rails bore hard at their extreme ends, at which point of
bearing the calculated twisting moment accounts for less
than one-half of the flexure observed in the flanges.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a>
<img src="images/illo023.png" alt="" width="400" height="321" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.</p>
</div>

<p>The girders upon removal in the course of reconstruction
again took the straight form, showing that the very
frequent development of the stresses named had not sensibly
injured the metal, though the bridge carried as many as
three hundred trains daily in each direction, and had done so
for very many years.</p>

<p>The deformation of the top flange only has been noticed,
yet the same tendency exists in the bottom, though the actual
amount is much less, both because the lower flanges are in
tension, and are also in great degree confined by the frictional
contact of the cross bearers, even where no proper ties
are used. In the case dealt with the bottom flanges of
the outer girders curved <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch outwards only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>With the broad flanges commonly adopted in English
practice, twisting of the girders, under conditions similar to
the above, will not generally be a serious matter; but with
narrow flanges possessing little lateral stiffness it might be a
source of danger.</p>

<div class="figc450"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"></a><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a>
<img src="images/illo024.png" alt="" width="450" height="282" />
<p class="caption_b"><span class="left49"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.</span>
<span class="right49"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.</span></p>
<p class="caption_e"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6. and <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.</p>
</div>

<p>The twisting may be limited in amount by introducing
a cross-frame between the girders, from which they are
stiffened; by strutting the girders immediately from the floor
itself, in which case they cannot cant to a greater extent
than that which corresponds to the floor deflection; or by
designing the top flange to be unsymmetrical with reference
to the web, as in <a href="#Fig6">Figs. 6 and 7</a>, with the object of insuring
that under the joint effect of vertical loading and twisting,
the stress in the flange shall at maximum loads be uniform
across the section, and allow it to remain straight. This
may be secured by making the eccentricity of the flange
section equal to that of the loading. For instance, if the load
be applied 3 inches away from the web centre, the flange
should have its centre of gravity 3 inches on the other side
of the centre line. It can be shown that this is true
throughout the length of the girder, and irrespective of the
depth. An instance in which flange eccentricity being in
excess, curvature outwards resulted, will be found in a later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
chapter on deformations, etc. It will not generally be
necessary to make the bottom flange eccentric, as it is
commonly tied in some way; but if done, the eccentricity
should be on the same side as for the top. The flanges
remaining straight under these conditions are not subject to
the complications of stress referred to in the case first quoted.
The author has adopted both the last named details in bridges
where he has been obliged to accept unfair loading of the
kind discussed.</p>

<p>It should be remarked that by the two first methods, if
the stiffening frames are wide apart and attached direct to
the web, there is a liability for this to tear, under distress,
rather than keep the girder in line.</p>

<p>There is one other possible consequence of throwing load
upon the flanges of a girder of a much more alarming nature.
In girders not very well stiffened, it may happen that the
frequent application of load in this manner finally so injures
the web-plate, just above the top edge of the bottom angle-bars,
as to cause it to rip in a horizontal direction. More
likely is this to happen with a centre girder taking load first
on one side, then on the other, and again on both together.
Cases may be cited in which cracks right through the webs
3 feet or more in length have resulted from this cause. It
is very probable, however, that in some of these cases the
matter was aggravated by the use of a poor iron in the webs,
as at one time engineers, from mistaken notions of the
extreme tenuity permissible in webs near the centre of a
girder, would, if they could not be made thin enough, even
encourage the use of an indifferent metal as being quite good
enough for that part of the work.</p>

<p>An instance of web-fracture from somewhat similar causes
may be here given.</p>

<p>In a bridge of 31 feet 6 inches effective span, and consisting
of twin girders carrying rails between, as shown in <a href="#Fig8">Figs.
8</a> and <a href="#Fig9">9</a>, the load resting upon the inner ledges, formed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the bottom flange, induced such a bending and tearing action
along the web just above the angle-bars,
as to cause a rip in one of the girders, well
open for some distance, and which could
be traced for 14 feet as a continuous crack.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig8" id="Fig8"></a>
<img src="images/illo026.png" alt="" width="600" height="101" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig9" id="Fig9"></a>
<img src="images/illo027.png" alt="" width="450" height="309" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed in the figure that the
<span class="lettsymb">T</span> stiffeners occur only at the outer face of
the web, and that the inner vertical strips
stop short at the top edge of the angles,
the result being that under load the flange
would tend to twist around some point, say
A, at each stiffener, inducing a serious stress
in the thin web at that place, while away
from these stiffeners the web would be
more free to yield without tearing. The
fact that at a number of the stiffeners
incipient cracks were observed, some only
a few inches long, suggests this view of
the matter.</p>

<p>A case of web-failure from other influences
coming under notice showed breaks
at the upper part of the web extending
downwards.</p>

<p>In this bridge, of 32 feet span, which
had been in existence thirty-two years,
the webs&mdash;originally <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch thick&mdash;were,
largely because of cinder ballast in contact
with them, so badly wasted as to be generally
little thicker than a crown-piece, and
in places were eaten through; in addition
to which, the road being on a sharp curve,
the rail-balks had been strutted from the
webs to keep them in position, the effect
of which would be to exert a hammering thrust upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
face of the web at the abutting ends, and assist in starting
cracks in webs already much corroded. A feature of this case,
tending to show that the breaks resulted as the joint effect of
waste and ill-usage by the strut members, rather than by excessive
stress in the web as reduced, is to be found in the fact that
the girders when removed were observed to be in remarkably
good shape&mdash;i.e. the camber, marked on the original drawings
to be 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, still showed as a perfectly even curve of that
rise, which would hardly have been the case if the lower
flange had been let down by web-rupture, the result of
excessive web-stresses.</p>

<p>Occasionally webs will crack through the solid unwasted
plate, in a line nearly vertical; not where shear stress is
greatest, but generally at some other place, and from no
apparent cause, either of stress or ill-usage. The writer has
observed this only in the case of small girders not exceeding
2 feet in depth; and, for want of any better reason, attributes
these cracks to poor material, coupled with some latent defect.
In a bridge having some thirty cross-girders, each 26 feet
long, about every other one had a web cracked in this
manner after many years&#8217; use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Web-cracks of the kind first indicated, are perhaps, the
most probable source of danger in plate-girders, of any which
are likely to occur. The fault is insidious, difficult to detect
when first developed, and perhaps not seen at all till the
bridge, condemned for some other reason, has the girders
freely exposed and brought into broad light. The manner
in which old girders are sometimes partly concealed by
timberwork, or covered by ballast, makes the detection of
these defects an uncertain matter, unless sufficient trouble is
occasionally taken to render inspection complete.</p>

<p>The manner in which girders with wasted and fractured
webs will still hang together under heavy loading seems to
warrant the deduction that, in designing new work, it can
hardly be necessary to provide such a considerable amount of
web-stiffening as is sometimes seen; experience showing that
defects of the web-structure do not commonly occur in the
stiffening so frequently as in the plate, and then in the form
of cracks.</p>

<p>A case of web-buckling lies, so far, without the author&#8217;s
experience. There is no need to introduce, for web-stresses
alone, more stiffening than that which corresponds to making
the stiffeners do duty as vertical struts in an openwork
girder; in which case it is sufficient to insure that the
stiffeners occurring in a length equal to the girder&#8217;s depth
shall, as struts, be strong enough in the aggregate to take
the whole shear force at the section considered, in no case
exceeding this amount on one stiffener. For thin webs in
which the free breadth is greater than one hundred and
twenty times the thickness, the diagonal compressive stress
may be completely ignored, and the thickness determined
with reference to the diagonal tension stress only.</p>

<p>There is one fault which frequently shows itself in
stiffeners though not the result of web-stresses, and when
performing an additional function&mdash;viz., the breaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="lettsymb">T</span> stiffener knees at the weld, where brought down on to the
tops of cross-girders, due to the deflection of the floor, as
shown in <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>. When such knees are used, the angle
may properly be filled in with a gusset-plate to relieve the
weld of strain and prevent fracture.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig10" id="Fig10"></a>
<img src="images/illo029.png" alt="" width="350" height="343" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10.</p>
</div>

<p>There is some little temptation in practice to make use
of the solid web as a convenient stop for ballast, or road
material. Special means, perhaps at the cost of some little
trouble, should be adopted, where necessary, to avoid this.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Main Girders; Open Webs.</span></h3>

<p>With these, as with plate-girders, deficiency of strength&mdash;i.e.
of section strength&mdash;is seldom so marked as to be a
reasonable cause of anxiety. In particular instances faults
in design may result in stresses of an abnormal amount,
though rarely to an extent occasioning any ill effects. The
practice of loading the bottom flanges at a distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the centre, the bad effects of which have already been dealt
with as applied to plate-girders, is not commonly resorted to
in girders having open webs, nor are these so liable to be
heaped with ballast in immediate proximity to essential
members of the structure.</p>

<p>Some defects are, however, occasionally seen which may
be remarked. Top booms of an inverted <span class="lettsymb">U</span> section are
sometimes made with side webs too thin, and having the
lower edges stiffened insufficiently, or not at all. Where
this is the case, the plates may be seen to have buckled out
of truth, showing that they are unable, as thin plates, to
sustain the compressive stress to which the rest of the boom
is liable. The practice of putting the greater part of the
boom section in an outer flange, characteristic of this defect,
has the further disadvantage of throwing the centre of gravity
of the section so near its outer edge as to make impracticable
the best arrangement of rivets for connection of the web
members. Further, since all the variation in boom section
is thrown into the flange-plates, the centre of gravity of the
section has no constant position along the boom&mdash;an additional
inconvenience where correct design is aimed at.</p>

<p>These considerations indicate the propriety of arranging
the bulk, or all, of the section at the sides, thus reducing or
getting rid of the objections named.</p>

<p>Where the bottom boom consists of side plates, only one
point demands attention. It is found that, though nominally
in tension, the end bays are liable occasionally to buckle, as
though under compressive stress, and need stiffening, not
excepting girders which at one end are mounted on rollers.
This might seem to indicate that the rollers are of no use;
but it is conceivable the resistance arises from other causes,
such as wind forces, or as in the case of a bridge carrying a
railway, in which the rigidity of the permanent-way may be
such that the bridge-structure, in extending towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
roller end, cannot move it sufficiently, causing a reversal of
stress on the lighter portions of the bottom boom at the
knuckle end; or by the exposed girder booms becoming
very sensibly hotter than the bridge floor, and by expanding
at a greater rate, cause this effect, from which rollers cannot
protect them.</p>

<p>In counterbracing consisting of flat bars it is desirable
either to secure these where they cross other members, or
stiffen them in some manner to avoid the disagreeable
chattering which will otherwise commonly be found to occur
on the passage of the live load.</p>

<p>Occasionally diagonal ties are made up of two flat bars
placed face to face, to escape the use of one very thick
member. Where this is done, the two thicknesses, if not
riveted together along the edges, will be liable to open, as
the result of rusting between the bars in contact, when the
evil will be aggravated by the greater freedom with which
moisture will enter the space.</p>

<p>Other matters relating to open-web girders will be more
conveniently dealt with under their separate headings, particularly
a further consideration of the relationship subsisting
between the booms and floor structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">BRIDGE FLOORS.</span></h2>

<p>The floors of bridges commonly give more trouble in maintenance,
and their defects are more frequently the cause
which renders reconstruction necessary, apart from reasons
not concerning strength, than any other part of such structures.
When it is considered that this portion of a bridge
is first affected by impact of the load which comes upon it,
and is usually light in comparison with the main girders
further removed from the load, and to which the latter is
transferred through the more or less elastic floor, the fact
will be readily appreciated by those not already familiar
with it.</p>

<p>The end attachments of cross and longitudinal girders
are very liable to suffer by loosening of rivets, or, more
rarely, by breaking of the angle-irons which commonly make
such a connection. A not unusual defect of old work, which
may also sometimes be seen in work quite new, where the
cross-girder depth has from any cause been restricted, is the
extremely cramped position of the rivets securing the ends.
There is small chance of these ever being properly tight, if
the act of riveting is rendered difficult by bad design. This
is the more objectionable if it happens that cross-girder ends
abut against opposite sides of the web of an intermediate
main girder, and are secured by the same rivets passing
through. At the best such rivets will not be well placed to
insure good workmanship, and the severe treatment to which
they become subject, as the cross-girders take their load and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
deflect under it, will be very apt to loosen them. The author
has seen a case of this kind (see <a href="#Fig11">Figs. 11</a> and <a href="#Fig12">12</a>)&mdash;rather
extreme, it is true&mdash;in which nearly the whole of the cross-girder
end rivets were loose, some nearly worn through, thus
allowing the cross-girders to be carried, not by their attachments,
but by resting upon the main-girder flanges, which
in turn, by repeated twisting, tore the web for a length of
4 feet; there was also pronounced side flexure of the top
booms. The movements generally on this bridge (of 42-feet
span), whether of main or cross-girders, were very considerable
and disturbing. It was removed after about twenty-three
years&#8217; use.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig11" id="Fig11"></a>

</div>

<p>There is no necessity, as a rule, for the ends of cross-girders
attached to the same main girder at opposite sides
to be placed in line. The author prefers to arrange them to
miss, by which device each connection is entirely separate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the riveting can be more efficiently executed, erection is
simplified, and the rivets will be more likely to keep tight.
Other special cases of cross-girder ends will be dealt with

<p>It is sometimes contended that cross-girders attached at
their ends by a riveted connection should be designed as for
fixed ends, in which case they are usually made of the same
flange section throughout, with a view to satisfy the supposed
requirements. But a girder to be rightly considered
as having fixed ends must be secured to something itself
unyielding. With an outer main girder of ordinary construction,
and no overhead bracing, this is so far from being
the case as to leave little occasion for taking the precaution
named. As the cross-girders deflect, the main girders will
commonly yield slightly, inclining bodily towards the cross-girders,
if these are attached to the lower part of the main
girders. The force requisite to cant the main girders in
this manner is usually less than that which corresponds to
fixing the cross-girder ends, and is, generally, slight. It is,
of course, necessary that this measure of resistance at the
connection should be borne in mind for the sake of the joint
itself, quite apart from any question of fixing.</p>

<p>Possibly, in quite exceptional cases, where very stiff
main girders are braced in such a manner as to prevent
canting, it may be proper to consider the cross-girder ends
as fixed, or for those near the bearings of heavy main
girders; but the author has not met with any example
where cross-girders, apart from attachments, appear to have
suffered from neglect of this consideration.</p>

<p>With cross-girders placed on either side of a main girder,
and in line, it may also, for new work, be desirable to regard
the ends as fixed, and to detail them with this in view. It
does not, however, appear wise to carry this assumption to
its logical issue, and reduce the flange section to any appreciable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
extent on this account. The fixity of the ends will, in
any such case, be imperfect; and when one side only of an
intermediate main girder is loaded, it can have but a
moderate effect in reducing flange stress at the middle of
the loaded floor beam.</p>

<p>Similar reasons affect the design of longitudinal girder
attachments to cross-girders, which, if intended to support
rails, cannot of necessity be schemed to come other than in
line. Where the floor is plated as one plane surface, there
will not usually be any trouble resulting if no special precautions
are used, as the plate itself will insure that the
longitudinals act, in a measure, as continuous beams, relieving
the joints of abnormal stress. If the plating is, however,
designed in a manner which does not present this advantage,
or if the floor be of timber, it is better to decide whether
the connections shall be considered as fixed, and made so;
or avowedly flexible, and detailed in such a manner as to
possess a capacity for yielding slightly without injury.
Those connections are most likely to suffer which are neither
of the one character nor the other, offering resistance without
the ability to maintain it. <a href="#Fig13">Figs. 13</a>, <a href="#Fig14">14</a>, and <a href="#Fig15">15</a> give representations
of three &#8220;spring joint&#8221; methods of insuring yield
in a greater or less degree. For small longitudinals it is,
perhaps, sufficient to use end angles with very broad flanges
against the cross-girder web; these to be riveted in the
manner indicated in <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>Liberal depth to floor beams is distinctly advantageous
where it can be secured, rendering it easier to design the ends
in a suitable manner, by giving room near mid-depth of the
attachment to get in the necessary number of rivets; or
where the ends are rigidly attached direct to vertical
members of an open-work truss, the greater depth is effective
in reducing the inclination of the end from the vertical, with
a correspondingly reduced cant of the main girders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
flexure of the vertical member, with smaller consequent
secondary stresses. In any case deep girders will contribute
to stiffness of the floor itself, favourable in railway bridges
to the maintenance of permanent-way in good order.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig16" id="Fig16"></a><a name="Fig17" id="Fig17"></a><a name="Fig18" id="Fig18"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 16, 17, 18.</p>
</div>

<p>A point in connection with skew-bridge floors occasionally
overlooked is the combined effect of the skew, and main
girder camber, in throwing the floor structure out of truth,
if no regard has been paid to this. The result is bad cross-girder
or other connections; or, in the case of bearers running
over the tops of main girders, a necessity for special
packings to bring all fair (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>). The author has in such
cases, where cross-girders are used, set the main girder beds
at suitable levels, in order that the cross-bearers may all be
horizontal (see <a href="#Fig16">Figs. 16</a> and <a href="#Fig18">18</a>). This may not always be
permissible; but, however the difficulty may be met, it
should be dealt with as part of the design. For small angles
of skew only may it be neglected.</p>

<p>Rivets attaching cross-girder angles to the web will occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
loosen, probably due in most cases to bad work,
together with some circumstance of aggravation, as in the
case of a bridge floor consisting of girders spaced 3 feet 6
inches apart, with short timber bearers between, carrying
rails. In many girders the top row of rivets, of ordinary
pitch and size, had loosened, allowing the web, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch
thick, a movement of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch vertically. The rails being
very close down upon the cross-girder tops, though not intended
to touch, had at some time probably done so, and by
&#8220;hammering&#8221; produced the result described.</p>

<p>Plated floors are often found which are objectionable on
account of their inability to hold water, arising sometimes
from bad work, as often from wide spacing of rivets. With
rivets arranged to be easily got at, and pitched not more
than 3 inches apart, a tight floor may be expected; but it is
still necessary to drain the floor by a sufficient number of
holes, provided with nozzles projecting below the underside
of the plate, and sufficiently long to deliver direct into
gutters, where these are necessary. Drain-holes should not
be less frequent than one to every 50 square feet of floor, if
flat, and may advantageously be more so. Gutters should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
slope well, and care be taken to insure practicable joints and
good methods of attachment&mdash;a matter too often left to
take care of itself, with considerable after-annoyance as a
result.</p>

<p>The use of asphalt, or asphalt concrete, to render a
plated floor water-tight is hardly to be relied upon for railway
bridges, though no doubt effective for those carrying
roads. It is extremely difficult to insure that it shall stand
the jarring and disturbance to which it may be subject, and
under which it will commonly break up, and make matters
worse by holding moisture, and delaying the natural drying
of the floor. In bulk, as in troughs, it may be useful, but
in thin coverings on plates it cannot be depended upon.</p>

<p>Floors having plated tops are sometimes finished over
abutments or piers in a manner which is not satisfactory,
either as regards the carrying of loads or accessibility for
painting. If the plates are carried on to a dwarf wall with
the intention that the free margin of the plate shall rest
upon it, there will be a difficulty in securing this in an
efficient manner. Commonly such a wall is built up after
the girder work is in place, making it difficult to insure that
the wall really supports the plate, the result being that this
may have to carry itself as best it can. In any case, severe
corrosion will occur on the underside, and the plate rust
through much before the rest of the floor; the masonry also
will usually be disturbed.</p>

<p>It appears preferable to form the end of the floor with a
vertical skirting-plate having an angle or angles along the
lower edge. This may come down to a dwarf wall, but preferably
not to touch it, the skirting being designed to act
as a carrying girder. A convenient arrangement is shown in
<a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>, which may be used either for a square or skew bridge.
It will be seen that the plate-girders have no end-plates, the
skirting referred to being carried continuously along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
floor edge, and attached to each girder-web, the whole of the
more important parts being open to the painter.</p>

</div>

<p>Trough floors consisting of one or other of the forms of
pressed or rolled section present the objection that it is almost
impracticable to arrange an efficient connection at the ends,
if they abut against main girders, and but little connection
is, as a rule, attempted, and sometimes none. The result is
that the load from these troughs is delivered in an objectionable
manner, and the ends being open or imperfectly closed,
water and dirt escape on to the flange, or other ledge, which
supports them. A description of pressed floor which promises
to overcome this objection, and provide a ready means
of attachment to the webs of plate-girders, or of booms
having vertical plate-webs, has within the last few years been
introduced. This has the ends shaped in such a manner as
to close them and provide a flat surface of sufficient area
for connection by rivets. Each hollow is separately drained
by holes with nozzles. Whether this type of trough will
develop faults of its own, due to over-straining of the metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in the act of pressing, remains to be seen; but as it appears
possible to produce the desired form without any material
thinning or thickening of the metal, the contention that no
severe usage accompanies the process appears to be reasonable.</p>

<p>That form of troughing in which the top and bottom
portions are separately formed, and connected by a horizontal
seam of rivets at mid-depth, is found in use upon railway
bridges to be very liable to loosening of those rivets near the
ends; less surprising, perhaps, because the sloping sides are
usually thin.</p>

<p>It is a distinctly difficult matter to join two or more
lengths of any trough flooring having sloping sides, in a
workmanlike manner; the fit of covers is apt to be imperfect,
and some rivets, being difficult of access, are likely to be but
indifferently tight, so that if the joint occurs where it will
be more than lightly stressed, trouble will probably follow.
A bad place for such joints is immediately over girders
supporting the troughs, as there the stress will be most
severe, any leakage come directly upon the girder, and remedial
measures be more difficult to carry out.</p>

<p>Timber floors of the best timber, close jointed, are more
durable than might be supposed. The disadvantage is a
difficulty in ascertaining the precise condition of the timber
after many years&#8217; use. The author has seen timbers, 9 inches
by 9 inches, forming in one length a close floor, carried by
three girders, and supporting two lines of way, which, when
taken out, could as to a considerable part be kicked to pieces
with the foot; whilst in another case, with the same arrangement
of girders and close-timbered floor, the wood, after
being in place for thirty-two years, was, when taken out,
found to be perfectly sound, with the exception of a very
few bad places of no great extent. In this instance, however,
it is known that the floor&mdash;pitch-pine&mdash;was put in by a
contractor who prided himself upon the quality of the timber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that he used; the floor being also covered with tar concrete,
which had in this instance so well performed its office as to
keep the timber quite dry on the top.</p>

<p>Jack arches between girders make an excellent floor for
road bridges, though heavy; and for small bridges may be
used to carry rails, if the girders are designed to be stiff under
load. The apprehension that brickwork or concrete will
separate from the girder-work, or become broken up under
even moderate vibration, does not seem to be well founded, if
the deflection is small and the brickwork or concrete good.</p>

<p>The use of corrugated sheeting as a means of rendering
the underside of a bridge drop dry cannot be too strongly
deprecated. If it must be adopted, the arrangement should be
such as to permit ready removal for inspection and painting.
It is evident that by boxing up the floor structure, rust is
favoured, and serious defects may be developed, not to be discovered
till the sheeting is removed, or something happens.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig20" id="Fig20"></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20.</p>
<img src="images/illo042a.png" alt="" width="600" height="82" />
</div>

<p>A case may be instanced in which it was found, on taking
down sheeting of this description, that the floor girders, previously
hidden, were badly wasted in the webs. One of
these girders had cracked, as shown in <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>, and others
were in a condition only less bad.</p>

<p>In any floor carrying ballast or macadam, if means are
not adopted to keep the road material from the structure of
the floor, or from the main girders, corrosion may be serious
in its effects. Cinder ballast is, perhaps, the worst in this
respect, in its action upon steel or ironwork, being distinctly
more damaging than any other kind commonly used.</p>

<p>Rail-joints upon bridge floors are to be avoided where
practicable by the use of rails as long as can be obtained; if
the bridge is small enough, crossing it in one length. At
each joint there is likely to be hammering and working
extremely detrimental to floor members and connections;
indeed, it may happen that loose rivets will be found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
neighbourhood of such joints, and nowhere else on the bridge.
Where rail-joints cannot be
avoided, their position should,
if there be any choice, be judiciously
selected, and the plate-layers
taught to close the joints
and jam the fish-bolts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig21" id="Fig21"></a>
<img src="images/illo042b.png" alt="" width="600" height="108" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 21.</p>
</div>

<p>As rail-joints upon a bridge
may injuriously affect the floor,
so also will a weak floor be
very trying to the rails. A
remarkable instance of this has
come under the writer&#8217;s notice,
where a bridge (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>) of
three 33-feet spans, having
outer and centre main girders,
with cross-girders spaced 3 feet
apart, resting upon the girder
flanges, but not attached, and
carrying two roads, had the permanent-way
in a very bad state.
The rails proper, with supplementary
angle-plates, rested
direct upon the cross-girders,
which were decidedly light,
and the whole floor had much
&#8220;life&#8221; in it, the ill-effect of
which was shown in thirteen
breaks in the angle-plates, in
each case near their ends,
generally at holes.</p>

<p>It appears probable that
severe stresses may be thrown
upon the parts of a floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
whether placed at the level of the bottom booms or of
the top, by changes of length in the booms due to stress.
The author has, unfortunately, no direct evidence to offer
in reference to this, tending either for or against the contention.
If an unplated floor of cross and longitudinal
girders of usual arrangement be at the bottom boom of
a large bridge, as the boom lengthens with the imposition
of load upon the bridge, all the cross-girders from the
centre towards the abutments will be curved horizontally,
the middle portion being restrained by the longitudinals
from moving bodily with the ends. Each cross-girder
except that at the centre, if there be one, will thus present
a figure in plan, concave towards the abutment to which it
is nearest. This will be accompanied by stressing of the
connections, and a transfer to the longitudinals of as much
of the tensile stress properly belonging to the booms as the
stiffness of the cross-girders may communicate.</p>

<p>This in itself will hardly be considerable, and will be the
less on account of a slight yielding which may be expected
at the end connections of each longitudinal; but the effect
upon the cross-girders by horizontal bending will be much
marked. If the case be supposed of a 200-feet span in steel
at ordinary loads and stresses, carrying one line of way, with
cross-girders 20 feet apart, and having no floor-plates, it may
be ascertained, neglecting for the moment any slight yielding
of the longitudinal girder connections, that upon the bridge
taking its full live load there will be the following approximate
results: Movement at each end of the end cross-girders
of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inch, equivalent to a force of 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> tons, tending to bend
them horizontally, and a mean stress on the outer edges of the
girders, 12 inches wide, of 8 tons per square inch due to
flexure, which, compounded with the ordinary flange stresses,
will seem to give rather alarming results. There will also be a
longitudinal stress in the rail-girders, at centre part of bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> ton per square inch. Normal elongation of the longitudinal
girder bottom flanges, and compression of the top, modifies
the figures unfavourably as to the cross-girder top flange.
Yielding of the connections named before has been neglected
in arriving at these stresses. If they are sufficiently accommodating
to give freely, to a mean extent, as between the
top and bottom of each joint, of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>29</sub> inch, these results will
disappear. It is evident, however, that we cannot rely upon
good work yielding without the existence of considerable forces
to cause it. In the issue it is justifiable to apprehend that the
flexing and stressing of the cross-girders will be considerable.</p>

<p>The most favourable case has been taken; if now it is
assumed that the floor has continuous plating, the results
would seem to be much more astonishing. It will appear on
this supposition that the boom stresses, instead of being
taken wholly by the booms, are about equally divided between
these and the floor structure, each cross-girder connection
communicating its share of boom stress to the floor, which
for the end cross-girders will approach 40 tons at each
connection&mdash;considerably more than the vertical reaction
under normal loads.</p>

<p>Palpably, these conclusions must be greatly modified by
the yield of longitudinal girder ends, and slip of the floor
rivets in transverse seams. If these rivets be 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch pitch
and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter, the stress at each, as estimated, would
be sufficient to induce shear of about 6 tons per square inch&mdash;more
than enough to cause &#8220;slip.&#8221; After making this allowance,
it is still evident there must be very serious forces at
work about the ends of cross-girders under the conditions supposed,
probably not less than one half the amounts named, as
with this reduction the floor rivets should not yield, given
reasonably good work. It is to be observed that the effect of
live load only has been introduced, on the presumption that the
longitudinals and floor-plating have not been riveted up till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the main girders have been allowed to carry the major part
of the dead load; but even this cannot always be conceded.
The deduction appears to be that the floor and cross-girder
connections should be studied with special reference to these
possible effects, either with the object of rendering the communication
of these forces harmless, or making the floor so
that it shall take little or no stress from the main booms, by
arranging joints across the floor specially designed to yield,
the ends of longitudinals being schemed with the same object.
Where there is no plating, the case is, perhaps, sufficiently
provided for by making the cross-girders narrow, and the
longitudinal girder connections flexible, or by putting these
girders upon the top of the cross-girders, when stretching of
the bottom flanges of the rail-bearers under load may be
expected, within a little, to keep pace with the lengthening
of the main booms.</p>

<p>It would appear that light pressed troughs running across
the longitudinals would, by yielding in every section, also
furnish relief, as compared with the rigidity of flat plates.</p>

<p>By placing the floor at a level corresponding to the
neutral axis of the main girders, the communication of stress
to the floor may be avoided; but it seldom happens that
there is so free a choice as to floor height relative to the
girders. This solution is, therefore, of limited application.</p>

<p>It is obvious that somewhat similar effects must obtain to
those considered in detail, when the floor structure lies at the
level of top booms, but with forces of compression from the
booms to deal with, instead of tension.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">BRACING.</span></h2>

<p>Bracing, whether to strengthen a structure against wind, to
insure the relative positions of its parts, or for any other
purpose, cannot be arranged with too great care and regard
to its possible effects. Forces may be induced which the
connections will not stand, with loose rivets as a consequence,
and inefficiency of the bracing itself; or, the connections
holding good, stresses in the main structure may, perhaps,
be injuriously altered.</p>

<p>To take a not uncommon case, let us suppose a bridge
consisting of four main girders placed immediately under
rails of ordinary gauge, and braced in vertical planes only,
right across from one outer girder to the other. If the
roads were loaded always at the same time, nothing objectionable
would result; but, as a fact, this will be the exception.
When one pair of girders only takes live load, and
deflects, the bracing under the six-foot will endeavour to
communicate some part of this load to the other pair of
girders. If the bracing is so designed that some correctly
calculated portion of the load can be transferred in this
manner, without over-stressing the bars and riveted connections,
there will be no harmful consequences; but if not, the
bracings will most probably work at the ends; this, indeed,
is what frequently happens. There is one other effect which
will ensue, if the bracing is wholly efficient; a certain twisting
movement of the bridge will occur, which increases the
live load upon the outer girder on the loaded side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bridge to the extent of 10 per cent., with a corresponding
lifting force at the outer girder on the unloaded side. These
amounts are not serious, but wholly dispose of any advantage
it is conceived will be gained by causing the otherwise idle
girders to act through the medium of the bracing. In road
bridges of similar arrangement, over which heavy loads may
pass on any part of the surface, it is clear that the use of
bracing between girders should not be taken as justifying
the assumption that the load is distributed over many girders,
and correspondingly light sections adopted, unless the effect
of twisting on the whole bridge is also considered, and justifies
this view; for, as already stated in the case of the railway
bridge, the net result may be to increase the girder stresses
instead of reducing them. Generally, it may be deduced
that the better plan for railway bridges is to brace the girders
in pairs, leaving, in the case supposed, no bracing between
the two middle girders, though there will be no objection to
connecting these by simple transverse members of no great
stiffness, to assist in checking lateral vibration. For road
bridges of more than five longitudinal girders, equally spaced,
it may be advantageous to brace right across, the twisting
effect with this, or a greater, number of girders not, as a rule,
leading to any increase of load on any girder. <a href="#Fig22">Figs. 22</a> to
<a href="#Fig25">25</a> give the distribution of live load, placed as shown, for 3,
4, 5, and 6 girders.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that these statements do not apply to
cases where there may be also a complete system of horizontal
bracing, the effect of which, in conjunction with cross
diagonals, may be greatly different, with considerable forces
set up in the bracing, and a modification of girder stresses.</p>

<p>These effects may be so considerable as to call for special
attention in design where such an arrangement is adopted.</p>

<div class="figc600"><a name="Fig22" id="Fig22"></a><a name="Fig23" id="Fig23"></a><a name="Fig24" id="Fig24"></a><a name="Fig25" id="Fig25"></a>

</div>

<p>Somewhat similar straining to that first indicated may
occur in bracings placed between the girders of a bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
much on the skew. If this is, on plan, at right angles to
the girders, as is commonly and properly the case, the ends
will evidently be attached to the girders at points on their
length at different distances from the bearings, which points,
even with both girders loaded, deflect dissimilar amounts,
and the bracing will, if at one end attached near a rigid
bearing, transfer some part of the load from one girder to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the other, notwithstanding that both girders may be of the
same span and equal extraneous loading. It would not be
difficult to ascertain the amount of load so transferred from
a consideration of the relative movements if free, and the
loads on the two girders necessary to render these movements
equal, if the deflections were simply vertical; but as there
will be some twisting and yielding of the girders on their
seats, the calculation becomes involved. If the bracing is
placed at about the middle of the girders, the effects noted
will be greatly reduced; first, because the difference of
movements near the centre will be less; second, any given
difference will correspond to a smaller transference of load;
and, third, because each girder will there be more free to
twist than at the ends. It therefore appears that bracings
between the girders of a skew bridge should not be placed
near the bearings, though they may be put, with much less
risk of injury, near the middle.</p>

<p>Cross-girders on a skew bridge are subject to forces
somewhat similar to those which may affect bracing, rendering
it desirable to design their attachments in a manner
which shall not aggravate the matter, but rather reduce the
effects of unequal vertical displacement of their ends where
secured to the main girders.</p>

<p>Crossed flat bars as bracing members are objectionable
on account of their tendency to rattle, after working loose;
but as this effect only ensues in bracing which has first
become loose (it being assumed that the bars in any case are
connected where they cross), this objection is not itself vital,
though greater rigidity is easily obtained by making all such
members of a stiff section.</p>

<p>Defective bracing between girders, from neglect of the
very considerable forces it may be called upon to communicate,
is very common; the writer has seen many such cases,
of which one is here illustrated in <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>.</p>

<p>This bridge, of the section shown, and 85 feet span, had
very light web structure. The bracings, of which there
were two sets, were wholly inefficient, the end rivets being
loose in enlarged holes. Upon the passage of a train there
was a positive lurching of the girder tops from side to side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The integrity of the bridge was really dependent upon such
stiffness as there was in the girders, and unplated floor.</p>

<p>A common but indifferent method of keeping the top
members of main girders in line is by the use of overhead
girders alone, frequently curved to give the requisite clearance
over the road. This cannot be considered as wholly
inefficient, as sometimes maintained, since it is evident that
the closed frame formed by the floor beams, the web members
of the main girders, and the overhead girder itself, must
take a greater force to distort it than would be necessary to
cause deformation of a corresponding degree, in an open
frame formed by the omission of the overhead girder; but it
is not a method to be recommended, its precise utility is
difficult to estimate, and, if the cross-girder attachments are
of a rigid character, tends to increase the stresses induced at
those connections. The latter consideration is, however,
not applicable to this arrangement alone. All overhead
bracing favours this by restraining the tendency of the top
booms to cant inwards when the floor beams are loaded; and
though this restraint may be quite harmless, it is desirable
that close attention be given to these effects in designing
bridges which make a complete frame more or less rigid in
its character. &#8220;Sway&#8221; bracing, sometimes introduced at
right angles to the bridge between opposite verticals, tends
to emphasise these effects by rendering the cross-section of
the bridge still stiffer, besides making it a matter of difficulty
to ascertain how much of the wind forces on the top boom
is carried to the abutment by the top system of bracing, and
how much by the floor. The author does not, however, mean
to suggest that it cannot be used with propriety, but rather
that extreme care is desirable in considering its ultimate
effect on the rest of the structure.</p>

<p>For girders of moderate depth there may be on these
grounds a distinct advantage in abandoning overhead bracing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and securing rigidity of the top boom, and adequate
resistance to wind forces, by making the connection between
the cross-girders and the web members sufficiently good to
insure, as a whole, a stiff <span class="lettsymb">U</span>-shaped frame; but this, with
the ordinary type of rocker arrangement under the main
girder bearings, will not be entirely free from objection, as
canting of the girders due to floor loading will throw extreme
pressure on the inner end of each rocker. There appears to
be no reason why the cylindrical knuckle should not in this
case be supplanted by a cup hinge, allowing angular movement
of the girder bearing in any plane.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig27" id="Fig27"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 27.</p>
</div>

<p>The efficient stiffening of light girders, as in the case of
foot-bridges, from the floor, where this is at the bottom
flanges, renders very narrow top booms permissible. This is
a decided advantage where lightness of appearance is aimed
at; but it is not unusual to see an attempt made in this
direction by introducing gusset plates of very ample proportions
between vertical members of the girders, and the projecting
ends of flimsy transoms, carried beyond the width of
the bridge proper, these being of a section wholly out of
proportion to the brackets they are supposed to secure.
Whatever may be the amount of strength necessary at the
point A, in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>, there should not be less throughout the
transom from one girder to the other. The degree of
strength and stiffness required in this member, and in the
vertical stiffeners is not, as a rule, great. Information to
enable this question to be dealt with as a matter of calculation
is somewhat scanty; but it would appear to be sufficient
to insure safety that, for an assumed small amount of curvature
in the compression member, the forces outwards corresponding
to this curvature, due to thrust, should be resisted
by verticals and transoms of strength and stiffness sufficient
to restrain it from any further flexure. It will, of course,
be necessary also to take care that the compression member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
is good as a strut between the points of restraint. A
simple and sufficiently precise method of dealing with this
question is much needed. In cases where the floor weight
rests on the flange projection, it is also necessary to give
the transom additional strength to an extent enabling it
to resist the twisting effort between any two of these
transverse members; further, resistance to wind on the
girder has to be provided in both transoms and verticals.</p>

<p>It may be hardly
necessary to insist
that bracing intended
to stiffen a structure
against wind, local
crippling, or vibration,
should be made
complete, not stopping
short at some
point, because it cannot
conveniently be
carried further, as
is sometimes done,
unless the strength
of those parts of
the structure through
which the forces from
the bracing must be communicated to the abutments is
sufficiently great, considered with reference to other stresses
in those parts which have also to be endured.</p>

<p>Bracing stopped short in this way, making only the
central part of a bridge rigid, may have the effect of increasing
the forces to which the unstiffened end members would
otherwise be liable. Such a structure would evidently be
much stiffer against wind-gusts than if no bracing existed&mdash;the
resistance to a blow would be increased; but the power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
maintain that greater resistance being confined to the intermediate
bays, the unbraced ends would be subject to greater
maximum forces than if bracing were wholly omitted. The
net effect may still be better than with no bracing, the point
raised being simply that of an increase of stress in particular
end members.</p>

<p>In the bracing of tall piers, the rising members of which
will be subject to any considerable stress, if the diagonal
members are not finally secured when the piers are under
their full load, or an initial stress of proper amount induced
in those members, the effect of loading will be to render
them slack; so that an appreciable amount of movement at
the top may occur before it can be limited by the efficient
action of the bracings. This effect under blasts of wind or
continual passage of trains may, indeed, be dangerous.
Similar considerations apply to the top wind bracing of deep
girder bridges, influencing also the bottom bracing in a contrary
manner, which calls for attention in fixing the unit
stresses for such members.</p>

<p>The bracing of sea-piers is very liable to slacken if made
with pin-and-eye ends, as is often done for round rods. The
detail presents advantages in erection, but is not altogether
satisfactory in practice. Such connections are continually
working. In the finest weather, with the sea quite smooth
but for an almost imperceptible wave movement, the lower
parts of such structures will be found, as a rule, to have some
slight motion. This is very trying to bracing; nor is there
room for surprise when it is considered that these oscillations,
occurring at about ten to each minute, never wholly cease,
and amount in the course of one year to over five million in
number.</p>

<p>Bracing attached in such a manner that there can be no
initial slack, or slack due to wear under endless repetitions
of small amounts of stress, will have a much better chance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
keep tight. The advantage presented by round rods in
offering little surface to the water, is more than negatived
by inefficiency of the usual attachments for such rods.</p>

<p>The author has observed that bracing of members possessing
some stiffness, and with good end attachments to ample
surfaces, appears to stand best in ordinary sea-pier work.
For such structures the bracing should consist of a few
good members, with a solid form of attachment, rather than
of a multiplicity of lighter adjustable members, which will
commonly give great trouble in maintenance; being very
possibly also, in the case of sea-pier work, in unskilled hands.
If round rods must be used, they will stand much better if
made of large diameter.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of bracing, it may not be out
of place to refer to wind pressure, as this may so much affect
the proportioning of the members.</p>

<p>Some years since the author had occasion to examine a
number of structures with respect to their stability. Of foot-bridges
from 60 feet to 120 feet long, three or four, when
calculated on the basis recommended by the Board of Trade
as to pressures upon open-work structures, worked out at an
overturning pressure of from 18 lb. to 22 lb. per square foot.
These bridges had been many years in existence; it is,
therefore, fair to assume that no such wind in the direction
required for overturning had expended its force upon them
as to the whole surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig28" id="Fig28"></a>
<img src="images/illo056.png" alt="" width="400" height="333" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 28.</p>
</div>

<p>Particulars were taken in 1895 of a notice-board, presenting
about 12 square feet of surface, which was blown down
in the great storm of March 24 of that year, at Bilston, in
Staffordshire. It was situated at the foot of a slight slope,
over which the wind came, striking the obstruction at right
angles. The board was mounted on two oak posts of fair
quality and condition, which broke near the ground at bolt
holes (see <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>). The force required to do this, at 9000 lb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
modulus of rupture&mdash;a moderate value&mdash;corresponds to 50 lb.
per square foot on the surface exposed above the break.</p>

<p>In the same neighbourhood, at the same time, considerable
damage was wrought in overturning chimney stacks, to
buildings and roofs; the general impression in the locality
being that the storm was of exceptional, even unprecedented,
violence. Bilston, it should be noted, lies high.</p>

<p>At Bidston Hill, near Birkenhead, on the same occasion,
a pressure of 27 lb. was registered. In another part of the
country it is said to have been 37 lb. Wind is so capricious
in its effects over small areas as to render it probable that the
maximum pressures have never been recorded; but this is
a matter of little importance where general stability and
strength only are concerned. The instances cited, though by
themselves insufficient to throw much light on the question,
may be of use in connection with other known examples.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">RIVETED CONNECTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>Considerable latitude is observable in the practice of
engineers in the use of rivets. Numberless experiments to
determine the resistance of riveted connections have from
time to time been made, but these are not to be considered
by themselves as final, when the results of experience in
actual construction, are available for further enlightenment.</p>

<p>The class of workmanship so largely influences the degree
in which rivets will maintain their integrity that it is only
by the observation of a large number of cases, including all
degrees of workmanship, that any reliable conclusions may
be drawn. In this respect laboratory experiments have an
apparent advantage, as the conditions may be kept sensibly
the same; but, on the other hand, no such investigation
reproduces the circumstances of actual use, which alone must
in the end determine the utility of any inquiry for practical
application.</p>

<p>The author has studied the particulars of a number of
cases to ascertain under what conditions as to stress, having
due regard to the effects of vibration, rivets will remain tight,
or become loose. Every loose rivet that may be found cannot,
of course, be taken as being due to excessive stress; the more
frequent cause is indifferent work, evidenced by the fact that
neighbouring rivets will frequently be found quite sound,
though the failure of some will cause a greater stress upon
the remainder. When rivets loosen as the direct result of
over-stress, it is usually by compression of the shank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
enlargement of the hole, or by stretching of the rivet and
reduction of its diameter. Instances of failure by partial or
complete shear are extremely rare; indeed, the author has
never yet found one, though when a rivet has first worked
loose, as a result of excessive bearing pressure or bad work,
it is not uncommon to find it cut or bent as an after consequence.</p>

<p>In estimating stresses at which rivets have remained
tight, or loosened, as the case may be, examples have generally
been chosen in which there could be no reasonable
doubt as to the amount of those stresses by the ordinary
methods of computation. This is clearly most important,
as, if any appreciable uncertainty remained as to the degree
of stress, the results deduced would be of little value. For
this reason those instances in which the loads upon girders,
or parts of girders, may find their way to the supports by
more than one route, are to be regarded with caution, as are
those in which full loading possibly never obtains, but which
may, on the other hand, perhaps have been frequent. The
working diameter of the rivet as it fills the hole has been
used in making the computations; in some cases from
direct measurement from particular rivets, in others with a
suitable allowance for excess diameter of hole, according to
the class of work under consideration.</p>

<p>Dealing first with main girders, it may be said that rivets
attaching the webs of plate girders to the flange angles rarely
loosen, though subject to considerable stress. In illustration
of this may be named a bridge for two lines of way, 85 feet
effective span, having two main girders with plate webs, and
cross-girders resting on the top flanges, previously referred
to (see <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p>The girders, which were 6 feet 9 inches deep, had a bearing
upon the abutments of 4 feet; the rivets were <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch in
diameter and 4 inches pitch. There is in a case of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
some little uncertainty as to what is the stress on the flange
angle rivets at, or very near to, the bearings; but, taking
the vertical rows of rivets at the web joints near the ends as
presenting less uncertainty, the stress per rivet works out at
4&middot;8 tons, being 4 tons per square inch on each shear surface,
and 11 tons per square inch bearing pressure upon the shank
in the web plate, which was barely <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch thick. This bridge
was frequently loaded upon both roads, but with one road
only carrying live load, the stresses in the more heavily
loaded girder would be fully 90 per cent. of those obtaining
as a maximum. There was on this bridge, which had been
in use 31 years, considerable movement and vibration.</p>

<p>It is by no means uncommon to find cases of rivets in
main girders taking 11 tons per square inch bearing pressure&mdash;occasionally
more&mdash;and remaining tight. As furnishing
an instructive, though slightly ambiguous, instance of rivets
in single shear, may be cited a bridge not greatly less than
that just referred to, of about 65 feet span, carrying two
lines of way, there being two outer and one centre main
girder of multiple lattice type, with cross-girders in one
length 4 feet apart, riveted to the bottom booms of the main
girders; these rivets, by the way, were in tension. The
floor was plated, the road consisting of stout timber longitudinals,
chairs, and rails (<a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig29" id="Fig29"></a>
<img src="images/illo060.png" alt="" width="600" height="186" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 29.</p>
</div>

<p>It should be noted that there is in this case some difficulty
in ascertaining the precise behaviour of the cross-girders,
affecting the proportion of load carried by the outer
and the inner main girders. Strict continuity of all the
cross-girders could only obtain if the deflection of the main
girders were such as to keep the three points of suspension of
each cross-girder in the same straight line. A close inquiry
showed that this was very far from being the case, and that
while each cross-girder at the centre of the bridge would,
under load, by relative depression of the middle point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
support, be reduced to the condition of two simple beams,
those at the extreme ends of the span would behave as
continuous girders.</p>

<p>With both roads carrying
engine loads equal to those
coming upon the bridge, the
author estimates that for the
centre main girder the shear
on the rivets of the end diagonals,
secured by one rivet
only, was 14&middot;9 tons per square
inch, and the bearing pressure
16&middot;3 tons; the flange stress
being 7&middot;1 tons per square inch
net. The outer main girders
are most heavily stressed when
but one road, next to the
outer girder considered, carries
live load. For this condition
the stresses work out at
9 tons per square inch shear
on the rivets of the end diagonals,
and 9 tons bearing
pressure, the flange stress being
5&middot;7 tons per square inch
on the net section.</p>

<p>Without intending to
throw any doubt upon the
substantial truth of these
results, it must be admitted
that instances of greater simplicity
of stress determination
are much to be preferred. For purposes of comparison, but
not as having any other value, the results have also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
worked out on the supposition of all cross-girders acting
each as two simple beams, and also for strict continuity, and
are here tabulated, together with the conclusions given above.</p>

<p>The cross-girders were moderately stressed, and the tension
on the rivets attaching them to the main girders
probably did not exceed 3 tons per square inch.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that the traffic over the bridge
was small. The centre main girder but seldom bore its full
load, though at all times liable to receive it. Much importance
cannot, therefore, be attached to the results for this
girder, other than as showing how a structure may stand for
many years, though liable at any time to the development
of stresses which would commonly be regarded as destructive,
or nearly so.</p>

<p>The material and workmanship of the bridge were good.
The rivets of the centre girder end diagonals, 1 inch in
diameter, were originally <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch, but on becoming loose were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
cut out, the holes reamered, and replaced by the larger size,
which remained tight, and to which the stress figures apply.
The rivets in the diagonals near the centre, <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch in diameter,
which were subject to reversal of stress, occasionally
worked loose, and were more than once replaced. The
riveting in the outer girder diagonals, subject to smaller
stresses, much more frequently developed, also gave trouble,
particularly those liable to counter stresses.</p>

<p>Apart from looseness of rivets, the general appearance
and behaviour of the bridge, which had been in existence
about twenty years, was not suggestive of any weakness.</p>

<p>Of smaller girders, an example showing the necessity for
care in discriminating, if it be possible, between looseness
of rivets resulting from over-stress and that due to other
influences may first be quoted. Two trough girders, of
11 feet effective span, each of the section shown in <a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>,
11<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches deep at the ends, 14 inches at the middle, with
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch webs, and rivets <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter, of 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch pitch,
showed certain defects, of which one, it may be incidentally
mentioned, was a cracked web (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>). From the nature
of the arrangement the lower web rivets, which were loose,
would receive the first shock of the load coming upon the
span, but there were evidences indicative of original bad
work. The angle bars gaped, suggesting that these had
first been riveted to the bottom plate, and left sufficiently
wide to allow the web to be afterwards inserted, the rivets
failing to pull the work close, and then readily working loose.
Here there is considerable uncertainty as to how much of
the loosening is to be attributed to bad work, and how much
to stress. It may, however, be remarked that whatever
bearing stress was the ultimate result of the load hammering
on the lower angle flanges, loosening rivets never perhaps
really tight, the stress of 7 tons per square inch bearing
pressure on the upper rivets, though aggravated by considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
impactive force, was not sufficient to loosen these. The
girders were taken out after being in place sixteen years.</p>

<div class="figc600"><a name="Fig30" id="Fig30"></a><a name="Fig31" id="Fig31"></a><a name="Fig32" id="Fig32"></a>

<p>An instance of undoubted excessive bearing pressure
was found in the cross-girders of a bridge, mentioned on
<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>, of which so many web plates were cracked. This
bridge, carrying two lines of way, had outer main girders,
and long cross-girders with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch webs and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch rivets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
4 inches pitch. The rivet stresses work out at 4&middot;3 tons per
square inch on each shear surface, and 24 tons per square
inch bearing pressure. For
one road only being loaded, the
latter figure falls to 18&middot;5 tons.
The traffic over this bridge,
twenty years old, was considerable,
rapid, and heavy. It is
hardly necessary to add that
a large number of the rivets
were loose, one of which is
shown in <a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig33" id="Fig33"></a>
<img src="images/illo064.png" alt="" width="600" height="186" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 33.</p>
</div>

<p>To take another case relating
to a floor system of extremely
bad design (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>).
The main girders were 11 feet
apart, 35 feet span, the floor
having two cross-girders only,
spaced at 11 feet 3 inches, and
9 inches deep, supporting hog-backed
trough longitudinals.
The cross-girders were at their
ends but 6<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches deep, the
distance from the bearing of
cross-girders to centre of longitudinals
carrying a rail being
2 feet 10 inches, in which
length were eight rivets in the
web and angles at the top, and
six at the bottom, all <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in
diameter.</p>

<p>The shear stress on the upper rivets works out at 7&middot;3
tons per square inch on each shear surface, the bearing pressure
20&middot;6 tons per square inch. On the lower rivets the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
shear stress becomes 9&middot;7 tons, and the bearing pressure
27&middot;4 tons, per square inch. Care was exercised in computing
these stresses, that part of the bending moment
carried by the web being allowed for, but it must be admitted
that the result is, probably, approximate only. The <a href="#Fig33">sketch</a>
here given shows the cross-girder end and section. The
rivets, though in double shear, were, as might be expected,
loose, notwithstanding that the traffic over the bridge was
moderate, and quite slow. The floor system was remodelled
after twelve years&#8217; use.</p>

<p>In illustration of the behaviour of rivets in the ends of
long cross-girders, both shallow and weak, and many years
in use under heavy traffic, may be cited connections having
end angle bars to the cross-girders, with six rivets through
the web of main girders. The bearing pressure worked out
at 7&middot;8 tons per square inch. Many rivets were loose, but it
should be remarked that the workmanship was not of the
best class, and the cross girders flexible: a characteristic
very trying to end rivets, and inducing a stretch in some,
already referred to as a possible cause of loosening. This
will be apparent if the probable end slope of weak girders
be considered. The author concludes that this inclination
should not, for ordinary cases, exceed 1 in 250; but the
ratio must largely depend upon the degree of rigidity of the
part to which the connection is made. It is commonly
regarded as bad practice to submit rivets to tension, yet this
is frequently, though unintentionally, permitted in end attachments,
without any attempt to limit the amount of
tension. With suitable restrictions, there appears no serious
objection to rivet tension for many situations.</p>

<p>Another instance of cross-girder end connections of a
different type is illustrated in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig34" id="Fig34"></a>
<img src="images/illo066a.png" alt="" width="300" height="328" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 34.</p>
</div>

<p>The main girders of the bridge were 12 feet apart, each
cross-girder end carrying its share of the half of one road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
The mean bearing pressure upon the rivet shanks works out
at 5&middot;8 tons per square inch for the six rivets of the original
joint, but in the particular joint shown some of the rivets
had loosened, making the bearing pressure upon the remainder
about 8&middot;7 tons per square inch. It is apparent
there must have been considerable stress on the top and
bottom rivets which loosened. These two rivets would also,
because of difficult access, be in all likelihood insufficiently
hammered up. The joints worked rather badly; the loose
rivets had &#8220;cut&#8221; to a considerable extent, a process materially
assisted by the gritty nature of the ballast (limestone),
particles of which, getting into the joint, contributed to the
sawing action; this had clearly been taking effect for some
considerable time. (See <a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig35" id="Fig35"></a>
<img src="images/illo066b.png" alt="" width="350" height="219" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 35.</p>
</div>

<p>The two cases of cross-girder ends given are both rather
exceptional in character, and in each case the defects appear
to be due to general bad design and workmanship rather
than to any serious excess of bearing pressure. This may
be illustrated by taking the common case of cross-girders,
2 feet deep, carrying two roads, and having end angle irons
riveted to the web and stiffeners of the main girders by ten
rivets in single shear at each end. In this example, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is, for old work, simply typical, and does not relate to any
specific instance, the bearing pressure on the rivets will work
out at from 6 to 8 tons per square inch, and will seldom be
accompanied by looseness of rivets, and then only as a result
of faulty work.</p>

<p>Some sketches of rivets taken from old bridges have
already been given in connection with the cases to which
they belong; a few others are here shown (<a href="#Fig36">Figs. 36</a> to <a href="#Fig40">40</a>)
to further illustrate what may be the actual condition of
rivets after some years&#8217; use, and how different from the ideal
rivet upon which calculations are based. These are, however,
bad instances.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that rivets may, if in double shear,
be loose in the middle thickness, due to enlargement of the
hole in the central part and compression of the rivet, and
yet show no sign of this by testing with the hammer. There
is, however, generally marked evidence of another kind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the &#8220;working&#8221; of the inner part, as, for instance, the web
of a plate girder, in which case a discoloration due to rust is
to be found along the edges of the angle bars, or a movement
may be detected on the passage of live load. Red rust is, in
fact, frequently an indication of something wrong, when no
other evidence is apparent. In plate girders having <span class="lettsymb">T</span> or <span class="lettsymb">L</span>
bars brought down and cranked on to the top of shallow
cross-girders, it is not uncommon to find the rivets attaching
these bars to the cross-girder tops loose, due to causes already
dealt with. The riveted connection should, as to strength,
bear some relation to the strength and stiffness of the parts
secured, if the rivets are to remain sound.</p>

<p>It may be well to give here a summarised statement of
the results already named, for purposes of ready reference.
These by themselves are not sufficient to enable working
stresses to be deduced, though they are instructive. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
author has found many instances of shear and bearing
stresses in excess of those usually sanctioned, under which
the rivets behaved well, but is not now able to give precise
particulars of these.</p>

<p>It is probable that the fact of a rivet being in single or
in double shear largely affects its ability to resist the effects
of bearing pressure, as commonly estimated. In the first
case, the rivet-shank must bear heavily on the half-thickness
of the plates or bars through which it passes, rather than on
the whole thickness; and it is to be supposed that under
this condition it will work loose at a lower average stress
than if it were in double shear, and the pressure better distributed.</p>

<div class="figc400"><a name="Fig41" id="Fig41"></a><a name="Fig42" id="Fig42"></a>
<img src="images/illo069.png" alt="" width="400" height="183" />

<p class="caption_e"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 41. and <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 42.</p>
</div>

<p>The author has no very definite information in
support of this contention, but suggests that for double
shear the permissible bearing pressure may probably be as
much as 50 per cent. greater than for rivets in single shear;
the difference being made rather in the direction of increasing
the allowable load on double-shear rivets, than in reducing
that upon rivets in single shear. The propriety of this
is evident when it is considered that the practice has commonly
been to make no distinction, so that whatever bearing
pressures are found to be sufficient for both cases may be
increased for those capable of taking the greater amount.
<a href="#Fig41">Figs. 41</a> and <a href="#Fig42">42</a>, here given, illustrate the behaviour of rivets
under the two conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>With reference to the amounts of the stresses to which
rivets may be subject, the author concludes, as a result of his
experience, coupled with a consideration of known laboratory
tests, that for all dead load these may be quite prudently
higher than is frequently taken. For iron the shear stress
to be 10 per cent. less than the stress of parts joined; and
the bearing pressure&mdash;for single-shear rivets, 20 per cent.;
and for double-shear rivets, 80 per cent. greater. For ordinary
mild steel the shear stress to be 20 per cent. less than
the stress in parts connected, and the bearing pressure equal
to it for single-shear rivets; and 50 per cent. more for rivets
in double shear, though the two latter values may probably
approach those for wrought iron in steel of the higher grades
sometimes used in bridge-work. For live load, or part live
and part dead load, the same rules may apply, the reduction
of the nominal working stress, arrived at by any one of the
methods in use which may be adopted, affecting both the
parts connected, and the rivets connecting them. For reverse
stresses it is advisable to keep the shear stress in any
rivet so low, say 3 tons per square inch, that the frictional
resistance of the parts gripped by the rivets shall be sufficient
to prevent any tendency to slip under the influence of the
smaller of the two forces to which the part is liable, to insure
that, if brought to a bearing in one direction by the greater
force, it shall not go back with reversal of stress. This requirement
may be open to some question with respect to
good machine-riveted work, but for hand-riveted connections
it may certainly be adopted with wisdom.</p>

<p>The following table will show at a glance how the stresses
proposed vary with the unit stresses governing the main
sections.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Tension on rivets to be limited to one-half the permissible
shear stress, the holes being slightly countersunk under snap-head.</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be objected that the shear stresses in the proposed
table are somewhat high for wrought iron and steel.
This feature is intentional, and is supported by the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that whereas there may be loss of strength in the members
of a structure by waste, there is no such loss in rivets,
if the work is so designed that there shall be no loosening.
Any allowance that may be desirable for loose or defective
field rivets is left to be dealt with as may be considered
advisable for each particular case, the table as it stands being
applicable only to riveting not below the standard of first-rate
hand work.</p>

<p>Cases of loose rivets in main girders over 50 feet span,
due to any cause but bad work, are extremely rare, unless
resulting from the action of some other part of the structure.
It may be stated broadly that for railway bridges of less than
perfect design, the nearer the rail, the more loose rivets,
generally at connections. This is, no doubt, largely due to
the severe impact of the load, the effects of which are greater
near the rail, both because of the small proportion of dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
load, and because this effect has been but little modified by
the elasticity of any considerable length of intervening girder-work.
In addition to this, it is quite usual to find the rivets
more heavily stressed, even though the load be considered
as &#8220;static,&#8221; in the floor system than in the main-girders,
though the reverse should be the case. It is unfortunate
that those parts which require the best riveting&mdash;viz., the
connections&mdash;are commonly dealt with by hand; and for
this reason it is the more necessary to design these with the
greatest care.</p>

<p>Any arrangement which favours the gradual acceptance
of stress by one part from another will contribute to the
integrity of riveted connections, and lessen the liability of
the material to develop faults. In other branches of design
this is well recognised, but appears in much old bridge work
to have been entirely overlooked.</p>

<p>Bridges carrying public roads very seldom furnish examples
of loose rivets; the conditions are generally much
more favourable, impact being practically absent, full loading
infrequent, and the proportion of dead load to live, high.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to insist upon rivets
being, apart from mere considerations of strength, sufficiently
near together to insure close work and exclude moisture.
Outside edge seams should never be more widely spaced
than 16 times the thickness of the plates; 12 thicknesses
apart is better. In the case of angle, tee, and channel sections,
the greater stiffness of the section makes wider spacing
allowable up to, say, 20 times the thickness; but this must
be governed largely by the amount of riveting required to
pull the parts close together. Where more than four thicknesses
are to be gripped by the rivets, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter is
hardly sufficient to insure tight work, and quite unsuitable
if the plates exceed <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch thick.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">HIGH STRESS.</span></h2>

<p>High stress, provided it be well below that at which immediate
injury results, or possible failure, is not uniformly objectionable.
It may be first considered relative to the absolute
and elastic limits of strength, next with respect to the range
of stress, and, finally, with regard to the frequency of application.
For practical purposes&mdash;that is, for the continued
efficiency of a structure&mdash;the limit of elasticity must be considered
to be the limit of strength, or, more strictly, the
limit for all those parts of the structure which must, so long
as it lasts, be liable to the original measure of stress. There
may be places in a bridge, however, over-stressed only in the
earlier period of its existence, which, by being over-stressed
and suffering deformation, permit the origin of this distortion
to be harmlessly met in some other way. In such a
case the injury done to that part does not, of necessity, lead
to any culminating disaster; indeed, were it not for this
plasticity it is probable a large number of bridges would fail
after being in use but a short time. As for riveting, so in
dealing with the amount of stress to which a member is
supposed to be liable, it should be clearly understood by what
method this has been arrived at, whether the value assigned
is the actual measure of the stress, or simply the conventional
amount arrived at in the conventional way; perhaps neglecting
web section in plate girders, or without regard to the
various influences which may reduce or increase the nominal
amount of stress, or including only a partial recognition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
those influences. In any case quoted the stress named is
that at which the author arrives by the ordinary methods of
computation carefully applied, where these appear to be
sufficiently precise, unless any qualifying remark be added.
Extreme flange stress is in special cases computed, first on the
gross section by estimating the moment of inertia on that
basis, and deducing the stress at the holes from the ratio of
net to gross section at the extreme fibres; a method more
correct than by reference to the moment of inertia of the net
section. Any exhaustive refinement in the study of stresses
is not attempted, both because it is beyond the author&#8217;s
powers of analysis, and for the reason that such results are
not comparable with the results of ordinary methods of calculation
in practice. Effective spans are taken at moderate
values, and all exaggeration is avoided.</p>

<p>The effects of impact in any part vary so much with
nearness to, or remoteness from, the living load, and the
frequency of development of the maximum stress from all
causes acting together is so much affected by the same consideration,
that it is apparent a nominal stress which may be
harmless in one part of a bridge may be destructive in some
other, a statement borne out by observation. Stress, as
ordinarily stated&mdash;i.e., at so much per square inch, uniform
across a section&mdash;is seldom a cause of trouble. In nearly all
cases of failure there is an accompanying localised destructive
stress, either in rivets or elsewhere, with crippling or deformation
of some essential part. In the tension flanges of main
girders with uncomplicated stress, this may run up to an
amount very considerably beyond the ordinary limits without
producing signs of distress. The same remark applies to the
compression flanges, if these be in themselves sufficiently
stiff, or properly restrained from side flexure. In support of
the above statement may be quoted the following instances
relating to wrought-iron structures<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>A bridge of 60 feet effective span, having girders
immediately under the rails, had a flange stress of 6&middot;3 tons
per square inch. Another of 64 feet span, carrying two lines
of way, with outside main girders and cross-girders, had the
flanges of the former stressed to 6&middot;8 tons per square inch.
A third, of 76 feet span, of similar construction to the last,
was stressed in the main girder flanges to 7&middot;5 tons per square
inch. The webs were not included in the computation; the
figures, therefore, compare with ordinary practice. In these
three cases the main girders showed no signs of distress,
referable to the results stated, though the top flanges in the
last case were curved inwards. The effect of this flexing of
the flange would be, of course, to increase the amount of
compressive stress along one edge, though to what degree
cannot now be stated.</p>

</div>

<p>A further instance of considerable flange stress occurred
in a bridge of seven nearly equal continuous spans, 25 feet
generally, the end and greatest span being 29 feet 6 inches,
centre to centre of bearings. Some details of the bridge are
given in <a href="#Fig43">Figs. 43 to 45</a>. The four inner main girders
under rails were 2 feet deep, with webs <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch thick over
piers, and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch at abutments, having flanges of two <span class="lettsymb">L</span> bars,
3 inches by 3 inches by <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch. There were also two
outer girders of the same depth, with single <span class="lettsymb">L</span> bars. Plate
diaphragms of full girder depth and particularly stiff were
carried right across the bridge at the centre of the spans,
and over the piers. The girders, though evidently designed
to be continuous, had very poor flange joints at each bearing,
of little more than one half the flange strength (see <a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>).
It is doubtful if the girders acted with strict continuity for
long after erection, as the excessive stress in the rivets of the
flange joint would, for that condition, have been nearly
sufficient to shear them. It is probable that this being so,
the joints first yielded, relieving the bending moment over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the piers, and increasing it near mid-span. Whether the end
spans be considered as strictly continuous with the rest, or
as simple beams, the maximum bending moments would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
greatly differ, though occurring for continuity over the pier,
for free beams at the centre. There is, however, an intermediate
condition which makes the moments at these two
places less than either maximum, but equal to each other;
a condition of semi-continuity agreeable to a partial efficiency
of the joints referred to. It is this state which has been
calculated, giving the minimum stress value that can be
accepted. The diaphragm has been assumed to transfer to
the outer girders a due proportion of the load. With this
explanation it may now be stated that, under engine loads
corresponding to those running, the flange stress worked out
at 7&middot;4 tons per square inch tension, web included, or 9&middot;7
tons per square inch without considering the web; which
stresses, it is more than probable, may have been greater.
The figures include the consideration of anything which may
contribute to lowering the stress, and are hardly to be compared
with those worked to in ordinary design of new work,
in which it would be quite usual to neglect the assistance of
the outer girders and the webs, to work to heaviest engine-loads,
and possibly include an allowance for the effects of
settlement. Dealt with in this way the girders would seem
to be of about one-fourth the strength that would be required
in the design of a new bridge, in which certain elements of
strength would be deliberately ignored.</p>

<p>The ironwork was in good condition, there was no ordinary
evidence of weakness apart from the calculated results,
the vibration was distinctly moderate, and the deflection,
though not recorded, was certainly small. The bridge did,
indeed, seem somewhat inert under load, and favours a
suspicion, the author entertains, that old girderwork long
overstressed may have a sensibly higher modulus of elasticity
than newer work at more moderate stresses. The traffic was
not very considerable, and both roads, of the same spans,
but seldom loaded at the same time; though with this construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of bridge there would in either case be very little
difference. The author recalls no reason for supposing that
the piers had yielded in any sensible degree. The bridge
was rebuilt after some thirty-six years&#8217; use.</p>

<p>Stress of considerable amount in the flanges of a latticed
main girder of 63 feet span has already been noticed in the
chapter on &#8220;<a href="#Page_45">Riveted Connections</a>,&#8221; which for the tension
boom worked out to 7&middot;1 tons per square inch, the flanges
in this case showing no signs of weakness. An instance has
also been given in dealing with a case of side flexure in
which the extreme fibre stress was calculated to be 10 tons
per square inch, the girder recovering its form when relieved
of load.</p>

<p>As to stress in cross-girder flanges, an example may be
quoted of a bridge of 109 feet span, carrying two roads,
having outside main girders, with cross-girders between;
these latter were stressed in the flanges to 6&middot;7 tons per
square inch (webs not included), if the partial distribution
among the girders (which were spaced 6 feet apart) by the
rails and longitudinal timbers be neglected. There is some
reason to think in this instance that distribution had the
effect of reducing the stress quoted, as the observed deflection
of the cross-girders was materially less than that calculated
for girders acting independently of each other, though
this may be in part due to a cause already hinted at.
Rigidity of the cross-girder ends, where attached to the
heavy main girders, would also tend to moderate the stress.
No very definite conclusion can therefore be deduced from
this instance.</p>

<p>To take another case of less uncertainty, the bridge of
35 feet span (see <a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>), referred to in &#8220;<a href="#Page_45">Riveted Connections</a>,&#8221;
may again be cited. The extreme fibre stress in the
cross-girder flanges worked out at 6&middot;3 tons per square inch,
web included, or 6&middot;5 tons, exclusive of the web. It cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be said in this example that the girders showed no signs of
weakness, as the deflection under live load was <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch on the
span of 11 feet, in addition to a permanent set of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch,
largely due, however, to &#8220;working&#8221; rivets.</p>

<p>A better and altogether conclusive case of the way in
which cross-girders may occasionally suffer considerable
stress, and show no sign, is furnished by two cross-girders,
of which some particulars are here given. These girders
occurred in the floor of a very acute angled skew bridge,
riveted at one end to the main girders in a manner which
was very far from fixing the ends, resting at the other end
on a masonry abutment. The first girder was about 19 feet
effective span, 12 inches deep in the web, with angle bar and
plate flanges. The girders were spaced 6 feet apart, and
were connected under the rails by <span class="lettsymb">T</span>-bars, cranked down to
face the webs, and riveted through. Though these <span class="lettsymb">T</span>&#8217;s had
little stiffness, yet the frequent vertical movements of the
girders relative to each other, under passing loads, had broken
the majority of the <span class="lettsymb">T</span>-bars at the bends, so that no notice
need be taken of these as transferring load from any one
cross-girder to its neighbour. The floor covering consisted
of timbers about 4 inches thick, also incompetent to transfer
any sensible proportion of the load on a girder to others 6
feet distant. Upon the floor was cinder ballast, with sleepers,
chairs, and ordinary bull-headed rails. The stress to which
the girder was liable works out at 8&middot;4 tons per square inch,
on the extreme fibres of the net section, web included; or
9&middot;1 tons, neglecting the web, under engine-loads of a
common amount. The other girder had an effective span
of about 22 feet, as before 12 inches deep in the web, with
angle bar and plate flanges. The stress per square inch was
10&middot;5 tons, web included, or 11&middot;1 tons per square inch,
neglecting the web. This girder carried three rails, one of
which was near to the abutment bearing, so that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
no great difference in the stress induced whether all three rails
were loaded or the pair only. The traffic over the bridge
was very great, but of moderate speed. It must have been a
common occurrence for the girders to take the full loads.
The heavier engines passed scores of times in a day&mdash;lighter
engines probably one hundred times. The bridge was about
twenty years old, yet these cross-girders, when removed,
showed no other sign of age and wear than that due to rust.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig46" id="Fig46"></a>
<img src="images/illo080.png" alt="" width="500" height="241" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 46.</p>
</div>

<p>All the foregoing instances relate to wrought-iron bridges.
Two cases of steel construction are here added, the first of
these furnishing an example of high girder stress somewhat
remarkable. This was found in a trough girder of a strange
pattern, of which a section is here given (<a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a>). The
bridge to which it belonged carried a siding, over which
engines of less than the heaviest class sometimes passed at a
crawling pace. The larger of the two girders carrying the
rails was 15 feet 8 inches effective span. The sides of the
trough consisted each of two vertical plates, originally <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch
thick, but wasted to an aggregate thickness of <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch.
These plates 6 inches deep, were connected at their lower
edges to angle bars, 3 inches by 3 inches by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, which
again were riveted to a bottom plate 16 inches wide,
originally <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch thick, wasted to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch. Lying in the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the trough, and riveted through the inner angle flanges,
was a bridge-rail. Assuming that the metal retained its
elastic properties from top to bottom of the section, at
whatever stress, this works out at 32 tons per square inch
at the extreme top fibre, and 15 tons at the bottom, on the
net section. As puddled steel, of which the girders were
made, may have a tenacity of 45 to 55 tons per square inch,
the assumption is probably correct. The author has no
record of the deflection, but it may be remarked it was
such that to stand under the girder, with a tank engine
passing over, required some determination.</p>

<p>A point of additional interest in this little bridge is that,
though made of steel, it dates as far back as 1861, having
been in use thirty-two years when removed. The particular
variety of steel used was known as Firth&#8217;s puddled. The
evidence of this consists in correspondence showing that permission
had been asked of the controlling authority, by the
only users of the siding, to apply this material, with no evidence
of any refusal. At about the same time this steel was also
used upon the railway concerned in the top flanges of some
girders of considerable span. The appearance of the trough
girders to which the foregoing particulars apply was distinctly
different to that which might be expected in ordinary
wrought iron. The top edges of the vertical plates were
wasted away, smooth, and rounded in a manner strongly
suggestive of a steely character. Finally, the way in which
the girders held up to their work for so long is, by itself,
conclusive on the point. The bridge-rail appeared to be of
wrought iron, the different modulus of elasticity of which
has been included in the calculation upon which the preceding
results are based. That these girders stood so well is,
perhaps, largely due to the fact that the load carried by them
was, though varying within wide limits, practically free from
impact, which, had the load passed over quickly, would, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
girders so small, shallow and flexible, have been very sensible.</p>

<p>The second instance of steel construction in which somewhat
high stress is manifest is that of some steel troughing of
the Lindsay pattern, used in a bridge built in 1885. The
troughs ran parallel to the rails, having an effective span of
18 feet 8 inches. The depth of the section (which is shown
in <a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>), was 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, making a ratio of depth to span
of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>28</sub>. The road was of ballast, sleepers, chairs, and 85-lb.
rails.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig47" id="Fig47"></a>
<img src="images/illo082.png" alt="" width="400" height="208" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 47.</p>
</div>

<p>Assuming this to be carried on six troughs, which corresponds
to 11 feet 3 inches of width, the extreme fibre stress
works out at 7&middot;5 tons per square inch, under usual engine-loads.
The bridge when examined after fourteen years&#8217; use was
in good condition, and at that time but little rusted; but the
end seam rivets were, as is not uncommon with such troughing,
loose. The traffic over the bridge was considerable, but
not at great speed.</p>

<p>On the opposite page are set out the results which have
been given, in tabulated form, as was done for rivet stresses,
to enable ready comparison to be made.</p>

<p>It would be unwise to infer from the instances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have been quoted that high stress may be regarded with
complaisance. In the most conscientious engineering work
there should still be a liberal margin for material possibly
defective, or even bad, for waste and deterioration, and for
the aggregate effect of minor errors in design, any one of
which considerations, except the first, by itself might not be
of great importance. The conclusion which may, however,
be derived from this and the previous chapters is, that bridge
failures are less likely to occur from high stress of a kind
readily calculated than from failure in detail, obscure and
little suspected, the reason for which is not perhaps apparent,
till the attention is forcibly directed to it by the refusal of
the structure to sustain the forces to which it may be liable.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">DEFORMATIONS.</span></h2>

<p>Instructive lessons are to be had from a study of the
various alterations in form to which metallic bridgework is
liable, which alterations may be due simply to the development
of stress of ordinary amount, and are then generally
small; or to abnormal stresses, the result of some distortion
in the bridge structure itself not originally intended, and
possibly extreme. In addition to these there may be deformations
due to settlement, to &#8220;creeping&#8221; of parts of the
structure relative to the rest, to temperature changes, to rust,
and to original bad workmanship. In any instance quoted
below the methods adopted to ascertain the amounts of such
alterations were quite simple, even crude; but as care was
exercised, and no attempt made to measure any very minute
changes, the results may be accepted as practically correct.</p>

<p>Dismissing for the present changes of form such as are
to be expected, and touched upon in other places in this
work, with respect to the particular parts of bridge structures
affected by them, a few instances will be adduced of
alterations which, though not very surprising, are such as in
the design of the work are hardly likely, in most instances,
to have been contemplated.</p>

<p>A case has already been referred to in which, owing to
eccentric loading of main girders, these were, as to the top
flanges, flexed sideways a considerable amount. It is proposed
to supplement this by further remarks relative to
somewhat similar cases. A like effect is frequently to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
observed in trough or twin girders, in which the rails are
supported upon longitudinal timbers resting upon projecting
ledges formed by the bottom angle-bars of such troughs.
In old forms of this arrangement it is common to find the
two girders forming the trough connected only by bolts
passing through the timbers, or just above them and below
the rails; or connected by narrow strips, which serve no
other purpose than to prevent the sides spreading at the
bottom. The top flanges in such cases commonly curve
inwards on the passage of the running load, accompanied of
necessity by an increase of compressive stress upon the outer
edges of the flanges, and perhaps by the working of any
flange-joint which may exist. This, both as to flexing of
the top flange and the working of a joint, was noticed in
the case of a bridge twenty-three years old, very similar to
that illustrated in <a href="#Fig8">Figs. 8</a> and <a href="#Fig9">9</a>, and described on <a href="#Page_13">pages 13</a>
and <a href="#Page_14">14</a>. The top flange consisted, however, of a bridge rail
riveted to the top edge of the web, butting at a joint, and
covered by thick cover strips (see <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>). The joint itself
was poor, and depended largely upon the character of the
butt, which was not sufficiently good to prevent the top
member kinking at this point, under the joint influence of
transverse effort and compressive stress, with possibly some
help from bolts passing through timber and webs, though
these being loose, the author does not think them at all responsible.
Although not strictly relevant, it may be remarked
in passing that it is very objectionable to use bolts as was
done in this instance; for as the timber settles down on its
seat, taking the bolts with it, these bear hard in the webs,
enlarging or even, as in this case, tearing the holes, accompanied
by injury to the bolts themselves. The practice is
now almost obsolete, but the example is instructive as showing
the impropriety of securing timbers by bolts passing through
them at right angles to the action of the load, unless these
bolts are quite free to move with the timber as it compresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>If trough girders must be used, the better plan is to
connect the two sides by a continuous bottom plate, the
trough thus formed being properly drained, if the timber
is not bedded in asphalt concrete; or to introduce stiff
diaphragms at intervals beneath timbers, if the depth
suffices.</p>

<p>In the case just quoted the curvature of the top members
of the girders was inwards, but in the instance given below,
of twin girders 26 feet effective span, with longitudinal
timbers between, resting, as before, upon the inner ledge
formed by the bottom flanges, the curvature was observed in
three out of four girders to be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch in a contrary direction,
the fourth remaining straight.</p>

<p class="caption_e"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 48. and <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 49.</p>
</div>

<p>An inspection of the accompanying section, <a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>, will,
perhaps, render the reason evident when it is noticed that
the top members are very unsymmetrical in form, the effect
of this being to give these members, under stress, a strong
tendency to flex outwards, apparently more than sufficient
to counteract the tendency of an eccentric application of
load on the bottom flange to bring them inwards. It is to
be observed that the eccentricity of the flange appears to be
not materially in excess, and is actually so, only because the
thinness of the web&mdash;<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch&mdash;renders it incompetent to keep
the bottom flange up to its work, and so secure the full
effect of the eccentric loading in limiting the outward tendency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
due to the section of the top member, the effects of
which are thus more apparent than would have been the
case with a stiffer web. Ties across from one bottom flange
to the other prevent the want of symmetry noticed in these&mdash;which,
by the way, is on the wrong side for utility&mdash;from
having any particular effect.</p>

<p>To give one other example of the consequences of eccentric
loading, a bridge of 48 feet effective span may be quoted.
This bridge carried four lines of way supported by five main
girders, trussed by kicking-struts in such a manner as to form
a bastard arch. A part section and plan are given in <a href="#Fig50">Figs.
50</a> and <a href="#Fig51">51</a>.</p>

<p>The floor consisted of Lindsay&#8217;s troughing resting upon
the lower flanges of the main girders, the three middle
girders, subject to eccentric loading, sometimes on one side,
sometimes on the other, were, with dead load only, straight;
but the two outer girders, liable to loading only on one side,
had, under repeated applications of such a load, assumed a
permanent curve towards the rails&mdash;<sup>13</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch in one case and
1 inch in the other&mdash;which curvature, no doubt, increased
when a live load came upon the contiguous roads, though
this was not measured. It should be remarked in passing
that, owing to settlement and the canting of the abutments,
the three middle girders were also &#8220;down&#8221;&mdash;in one case <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
inch. The girders, with one near road loaded, deflected <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch&mdash;greatly
less than would have been the case had the main
girder not been trussed. The bridge, at the time these particulars
were obtained, had been in existence six years.</p>

<p>Deformations due to settlement may be very considerable.
The author recalls two instances affecting continuous girders.
In the first of these, a bridge twenty years old, of two spans
of about 50 feet each, and with girders 4 feet 6 inches deep,
the centre pier had sunk 4 inches, reducing the spans, as
respects the dead load, practically to the condition of simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a><br /><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
beams, just resting, but hardly bearing, upon the piers when
free of live load.</p>

<p>In the second case, also of two openings of about 55 feet
each, with girders 8 feet deep, one abutment had sunk about
3 inches, more than doubling the stresses over the centre
pier. It is manifest that continuous girders should only be
adopted where settlement of the supporting points is not
likely to occur to any material degree. If this cannot be
relied upon, the theoretical flange sections may hardly be
worked to with any prudence; it being then advisable to
make a liberal allowance for settlement stresses, in which
case any economical advantage that should exist will probably
disappear. It is, however, to be acknowledged that so long
as the girders are in touch, under dead load, with the bearings
intended to support them, the stresses due to a live load
are unaltered, the principal effect in this case being that the
variation in stress due to the live load ranges between limits
that are higher or lower in the scale of stress than is the
case with bearings undisturbed; still, if it is desired that
the maximum stress shall not exceed, say, 6 tons per square
inch, it can hardly be a matter of indifference that settlement
shall induce a maximum of, perhaps, 10 tons, as in that case
the stress must be 4 tons nearer the limit of statical strength.</p>

<p>Before leaving this matter it may be well to point out
that in the case of continuous girders of uniform section a
moderate settlement of the piers may even be advantageous
by reducing the moments over the piers, and possibly making
them equal to those obtaining near the middle of the spans,
in which case there will be less inequality of stress in the
booms and a reduction of the maximum stress.</p>

<p>Bridges consisting of simple main girders connected by
cross-girders may be very prejudicially affected by unequal
settlement; for instance, if one girder bearing settles more
than the others, a twist is put upon the structure very trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to the floor-girder connections, and possibly to the main
girders; to the web if a plate girder, or to the verticals if
an open-webbed truss with rigid cross-girder attachments.
Indeed, settlement of this kind may be much more destructive
to a metallic bridge than to an arch of brick or masonry,
the commonly accepted opinion notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Instances of deformations due to the creeping of some
part of the structure away from its work, are within the
author&#8217;s knowledge, rare; except in the case of the ends of
main girders in skew bridges, already referred to.</p>

<p>Distortion, the result of temperature changes, is frequently
to be observed in any considerable length of girder
flange or parapet where there is not freedom of movement,
unless due provision is made to check it.</p>

<p>It is quite common to see parapets out of line, either
because the ends are not free, or because the light work of
the parapet being more exposed to the sun&#8217;s rays than the
girder work to which the lower part is attached, expanding
to a greater degree, is subject to considerable compressive
force, and buckles under its influence. The cure for this
condition is obviously to provide such parapets with free or
flexible joints at moderate distances apart, or to make the
parapet sufficiently stiff to take the stresses developed, without
crippling. A parapet may also go out of shape if directly
attached to the top flange of a girder liable to heavy loading,
particularly if the girder be shallower than the parapet,
simply by its inability to maintain truth of line under the
compressive stress, which it shares with the top flange of the
girder proper.</p>

<p>Rivets spaced too far apart, by allowing the plates or
other parts to spring open slightly, and permitting moisture
to enter, results in the growth of rust, which, as it swells in
forming, forces the parts asunder, and may set up considerable
stress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Flat bars riveted together by rivets spaced 12 inches
apart may from this cause be forced asunder, as much as <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inch, sufficient to set up a stress, with any practicable thickness
of bar, much exceeding the elastic limit.</p>

<p>Local distortions may occur as the result of imperfect
workmanship or careless erection, causing quite possibly very
severe local stresses; or girder flanges may be out of straight
as a result of riveting up along one side first, instead of
advancing the riveting simultaneously along the whole
breadth of the flange. The injury done by drifting is well
known, and there is reason to think considerable damage is
sometimes done to girderwork during manufacture by rough
treatment to make the work come together; but the author
has little to offer with respect to these matters that is not
common knowledge. It may, however, be pointed out in
passing that a bridge upon the design of which great care
has been expended, with the idea that theoretical propriety
shall not be violated, may be completely spoiled in this
respect by careless construction. Fortunately, both steel
and wrought iron, if of good quality, are long suffering.
Incompetent erection will sometimes result in the true girder
camber not appearing, or in differences as between girders
supposed to be similar. This is not, of course, a deformation
in the sense in which the word has previously been used, but
it is desirable to bear the fact in mind as a possible cause of
defective camber in dealing with questions of deformation.</p>

<p>The foregoing has reference chiefly to alterations of form
in bridgework of wrought iron or steel, but a case of considerable
interest is that of a cast-iron arched structure, of
which the author made a very complete examination.</p>

<p>This bridge, built in 1839, and carrying two lines of
railway, consisted of three spans, 100 feet each, of 10 feet
rise, made up of four inner and two outer ribs, each rib
being in three nearly equal parts; the floor was of timber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the abutments and piers of masonry. As originally constructed
there was no bracing between the ribs other than
the frames indicated on the plan here given (<a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
stretching from outer rib to outer rib in the neighbourhood
of the rib joints, which were simple butts without bolts or
any equivalent means of connection. The floor was, however,
braced in the horizontal plane, and the structure was
also braced over the masonry piers. After forty-two years&#8217;
use supplementary distance-pieces were introduced between
the ribs, but still no bracing between them, or any efficient
means of checking lateral movement. A crack developing
in one of the outer ribs at the crown, led to an investigation
to trace the cause, the bridge then being fifty-four years old.
Careful plumbing of the abutments revealed the fact that
three out of four abutment pilasters were out of the vertical,
as shown in <a href="#Fig52">Figs. 52</a> and <a href="#Fig53">53</a>, the greatest amount being
<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch in 6 feet&mdash;at that corner from which the cracked rib
had its springing; there was also other evidence of settlement
in an old crack extending from the top of the abutment
to the ground level, although this movement was very old,
certainly as to the greater part. The ribs of this span were
also out of plumb, that which was cracked being 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches
out at the centre. The joints of the ribs, which, as already
stated, were simple butts, in some cases opened and shut, as
the load passed over, in such a way as to suggest that the
ribs were acting, in a manner, as four-hinged arches, of
which two hinges were at the springing, and the other two
at the joints, one of which would for most positions of the
load be out of use, reducing the rib to the three-hinged condition;
in other words, as the rolling load passed over the
span, one or other of the two joints of a rib would &#8220;gape&#8221;
an appreciable amount at the bottom or at the top. Observations
were taken by means of a theodolite placed below,
either upon the bank or upon the tops of the masonry piers,
sighting upon suitable scales attached to the ribs to ascertain
the amounts of vertical and horizontal movement during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
passage of trains over the bridge. The principal results are
set forth in the following table<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The lateral movements are to either side of the mean
position.</p></blockquote>

<p>The particulars for spans 2 and 3 were obtained with
the instrument set up on the pier between these spans. The
tremor of this pier was such that no useful readings for
lateral movement could be obtained. Further, as the rolling
load came upon these spans, the effect was to rock the pier
to an extent vitiating the readings for vertical displacement;
but by sighting upon the fixed abutment, and observing the
amount of this rocking, suitable corrections were made in
the apparent rib movements. The figures given in the table
are thus corrected. The pier rocking was equivalent, as an
extreme, to an inclination from the vertical of 1 in 3200.
An attempt to measure the horizontal movement of the pier-top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was unsuccessful, owing to the impracticability of setting
up the instrument in a suitable position, sufficiently near to
the pier to enable readings to be satisfactorily taken. This
horizontal displacement probably amounted to about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch
either way. The rise and fall of the arches, and rocking
either way of the piers, varied, as might be expected, in
accordance with the position of the running load with respect
to the spans. Summarising the results, the greatest vertical
movements downwards were 0&middot;20 inch, 0&middot;40 inch, and 0&middot;22
inch for spans Nos. 1, 2, and 3, the upward movements being
0&middot;08 inch and 0&middot;13 inch for the first and second spans,
there being no recorded result of this kind for the third
span. With adjacent ribs loaded, the movement of the
ribs unloaded was one from one-third to one-half of the full
amounts. It is to be noted that the lateral displacement in
no case exceeded 0&middot;04 inch either way, nor were the vertical
movements exceptional; yet, as a matter of sensation, when
seated upon the ironwork, it was a little difficult to believe
them really so moderate. Observations were also made to
ascertain the rise of the arches from winter to summer temperatures,
with the result that this was found to be 0&middot;45
inch, 0&middot;45 inch, and 0&middot;55 inch for the spans in order, the
extreme temperatures being fairly representative of the
English winter and summer. The structure was, as a consequence
of the examination, efficiently braced by diaphragms
between the ribs, and diagonals following the arch ribs round
from springing to springing, with satisfactory results. The
crack already referred to, and its probable causes, will be
dealt with under &#8220;<a href="#Page_141">Cast-Iron Bridges</a>.&#8221; Eventually this
bridge was reconstructed to meet the requirements of growing
engine-loads.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">DEFLECTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>Deflection, considered only as a fraction of the span, and
without regard to other conditions affecting it, is of very
little use as an indication of a girder&#8217;s fitness for its work;
but when taken with reference to the depth of the girder,
the nature and amount of the load producing flexure, and,
further, with regard to the quality of the workmanship and
normal properties of the material of which the beam is constructed,
it may be of some little service in helping to form
a reliable opinion. This consideration applies with less
force, perhaps, to new work than to old, in which there may
be unknown influences at work, or unknown defects which
by excessive deflection may be betrayed. Though too much
importance should not be attached to results of deflection
tests in any one instance, yet the practice of observing such
movements, and considering them with reference to each
case, gives a good general idea of what may be expected in
a fresh instance, any material departure from which should
be a reason for specific inquiry as to the cause. A further
reason with new work is found in the evidence it affords as
to whether the loads carried travel to the supports really as
intended, or by some route not contemplated; or, in the case
of floor beams, in what way the load is distributed amongst
them, if, indeed, there be any such distribution.</p>

<p>The author has commonly found that new work gives
greater deflections than old&mdash;i.e., while calculation gives
the same result for each, it does not apply equally well to
both. The differences may be accidental, but are probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
due to other causes, perhaps to the fact that new work has
not by repeated applications of load lost the resilience of
parts liable to considerable local stress, such as is very liable
to occur at connections, so that the deflection is, whilst new,
greater than after many years&#8217; use, by which time such parts
may develop a definite &#8220;set,&#8221; and contribute in a less degree,
or not at all, to the total elastic deformation.</p>

<p>It is also possible, as already suggested, that repeated
high stress may reduce the ratio of strain to stress, the
material gradually becoming more rigid, the modulus of
elasticity being, in fact, increased.</p>

<p>In girders of ordinary construction, the major part of
the deflection is due to the booms, the remainder to the web;
the latter is for plate girders a small amount only, and is
commonly neglected, but for open web constructions it may
be quite appreciable. For any given type of web arrangement
the deflection due to the web will, for all depths, remain
a constant quantity for the same span and unit stress; and
though a moderate fraction of the whole deflection for a
shallow girder, it may be a very considerable part for a girder
of great depth, in which that part due to the booms is, of
course, smaller, since the deflection due to these varies
inversely as the girders&#8217; depths.</p>

<p>Deflection, being dependent upon the elasticity of the
material, is of necessity very largely influenced by the value
of its modulus E, itself liable to considerable variation, and
is increased in a small degree by the yield of joints and rivets,
which effect, apart from the initial &#8220;set&#8221; of the girders,
appears to be negligible. The stiffness of members in resisting
angular distortion at connections must also, for open-web
riveted structures, affect the result, making it somewhat less,
and, finally, section excess at joints and gusset attachments
has an influence in modifying deflection as compared with
that due to the normal gross sections simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>From these considerations it is apparent that any simple
deflection formula must be largely empiric in its nature.
For plate girders of uniform depth and flange stress, the
writer has found the following to give good results<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula"><span class="division"><span class="num">S<sup>2</sup></span><span class="denom">D &times; C</span></span> &times; <i>f</i> = deflection in inches.</p>

<p>The span S and depth D are, as a matter of convenience,
taken in feet; the constant C is for wrought iron 3500, and
for mild steel 4000; <i>f</i> is the mean of the extreme tensile
and compressive stresses of the booms, in tons per square
inch, estimated upon the gross sections.</p>

<p>This, though satisfactory for plate girders, is not so suited
to girders having open webs, in which the deflection will
more nearly be</p>

<p class="formula"><span class="fsize150">(</span><span class="division"><span class="num">3S</span><span class="denom">C</span></span> + <span class="division"><span class="num">S<sup>2</sup></span><span class="denom">D &times; C</span></span><span class="fsize150">)</span> &times; <i>f</i>,</p>

<p>the constant C being 3900 and 4450 for iron and steel respectively.
The latter values of C correspond to normal
values of the modulus of elasticity of 11,700 and 13,350 tons
for iron and for steel, it being assumed that any slight rivet
yield is off-set by any small section excess&mdash;say, 5 per cent.;
it may, however, happen that section excess is greater than
assumed, in which case some allowance may properly be made
for this by increasing C.</p>

<p>To adapt the formul&aelig; to girders other than those having
parallel booms and uniform stress, the results, as deduced
above, may be multiplied by constants given in column B of
the Table given on <a href="#Page_93">page 93</a>.</p>

<p>The practice of adopting for E in deflection formul&aelig; a
quantity much smaller than its nominal amount, with the
object of allowing in riveted girder work for the yield of
rivets and of joints, can hardly now be defended, whatever
may have been a case at a time when workmanship was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
inferior, when there was no machine riveting, and joints
were, owing to the small weight of plates and bars, three
times as numerous.</p>

<p>The initial &#8220;set&#8221; of a girder consequent upon first loading
is a quantity quite distinct from deflection proper, and may
be so small as to be negligible, or read 10 per cent. of the
true deflection, varying with design and workmanship.</p>

<p>No estimate of girder deflection can be even approximately
true if there is, at the level of the top or bottom flanges, a
plated or otherwise rigid floor system which is not taken into
account, as this will have the effect of very materially reducing
the boom stress. To neglect this influence, where it
exists, must necessarily lead to disappointing results, and it
is quite practicable in many instances to include it in the
calculation.</p>

<p>The influence of angular distortion between the various
members has been neglected. It may be pointed out, however,
that the resistance accompanying these movements in
girders having riveted connections, though unimportant as
affecting deflection, is worth some consideration in regard
to secondary stress. For girders of similar type and unit
stress these angular variations will be the same in amount
for any span, but will generally be of less importance in large
girders than in small, because in large girders the ratio of the
breadth of members to their length is commonly less.</p>

<p>When determining the probable deflection of any girder
of exceptional figure, it will be found convenient to make a
strain diagram&mdash;an old device, in which the actual alterations
of length being ascertained for all members, the girder is
carefully set out to a suitable scale, with the lengths of
members increased or reduced by the actual estimated
amounts. The distorted figure resulting will then give the
probable deflection. The value of E for this purpose should
never be taken at less than the normal amount, and may for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a considerable excess of metal in joints and gussets be made
as much as 10 per cent. greater, this being a convenient
means of making the necessary correction.</p>

<p>The effect of loads quickly applied may here be considered
in connection with elastic deformations of girders
of the same span, but different depths. If these be designed
for similar loads and unit stresses, the deflections due to
webs and booms of the girders compared will bear the same
relation, each to each, as do the weights, whether in both
cases the loads be inert or quickly applied, from which it
follows that the mechanical &#8220;work&#8221; done by the loads in
falling through the deflection heights is, neglecting inertia,
always in proportion to the girderwork weights, and is a
similar amount per ton, which as the total length of members
remains substantially unaltered, corresponds to a similar
amount of work per unit of section, or similar stress, irrespective
of the depth of the girders.</p>

<p>But for a &#8220;drop&#8221; load, as when there is some obstruction
upon a railway bridge, there will be in addition a further
amount of work to be absorbed, which is to be considered
the same whatever the girder&#8217;s depth, and will for deep
girders be a larger amount per ton of girderwork than in
those that are shallow; this, taking effect on members of
the same aggregate length, but lighter, will develop a higher
stress than in girders of lesser depth, more particularly in
the booms.</p>

<p>The influence of the girder&#8217;s inertia in modifying drop-load
effects will also be less marked in deep&mdash;i.e., light&mdash;girders
than in girders shallow and heavy.</p>

<p>It is, notwithstanding all this, desirable that the depth
of main girders should be liberal for economy&#8217;s sake, and
also that of floor beams, for reasons already dealt with; the
probability of the drop load is somewhat remote, and, though
possible, would simply induce, if it occurred, an increment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of stress rather more important in deep girders, making it
specially desirable in these to give particular attention to
the detailing of any connections liable to suffer from impact
effects.</p>

<p>It should be remarked that for short and very flexible
beams, generally outside the limits of practice, there may
also be, under quickly moving loads, a material increase of
stress due to the centrifugal effort of the load on running
round the deflection curve, and in rising upon the steep part
of the curve beyond the girder&#8217;s centre. Where advisable,
these effects may be modified by cambering the rail.</p>

<p>For pin bridges in which there may be spring in the
pins, excess stress in some eye-bars due to inequalities of
length, and a want of that rigidity peculiar to riveted structures,
the deflection will be greater than above indicated for
girders of the ordinary English type.</p>

<p>The method in common use for measuring the deflections
of girders but a moderate distance above the ground
by means of sliding-rods, though crude, gives, with care,
results sufficiently accurate for most practical purposes; but
some points necessary to remember may be mentioned with
propriety. The lower rod should rest firmly upon something
solid, say a stone, well bedded and free from any tendency
to rock; the upper end should bear against some part of
the girder above, presenting a hard surface, free from dirt
or scale, and as the running load approaches the bridge it
should be ascertained that there is no slack, that the rods
bear hard at the top and bottom. The upper end having
been depressed, care is to be exercised to make sure of the
reading before the rods alter their relation to each other.
These precautions are so self-evident that an apology is
almost necessary for mentioning them.</p>

<p>To ascertain deflections with a single pair of rods is only
allowable when the girders rest firmly on their bearings; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
felt has been placed under the girder ends, or if the bedstones
are insecure or rocking, it is necessary to use three
pairs of rods, one pair at the middle and a pair at each end,
in which case the mean of the two end readings must be
deducted from the reading of that at the centre to get the
desired result.</p>

<p>In the case of a number of spans in series, each resting
upon sill girders common to two sets of bearings, this
method also gives results of indifferent reliability, as the
depression of each end may be greater as the travelling load
comes upon and leaves the span than when it is precisely
over the middle, and it is in general out of the question to
secure by this mode simultaneous readings for a particular
position of the running load, which are what is required.</p>

<p>The author suggests, as a means of ascertaining deflections
free from these objections, that it should be done by
first measuring the slope at one end, and from this deducing
the deflection at the centre.</p>

<p>This is to be accomplished by means of a little instrument,
consisting of a telescope with cross-hair sights, and
fitted with a reflecting prism at the eye-piece capable of
being turned round, so that the observer has a wide choice
as to the position he assumes with reference to the instrument,
and may look either directly through it, or at right
angles to the axis of the telescope. This is clamped at one
end of the girder over the bearing, at the other end a scale
is secured, to which the telescope is directed, the cross hair
being made to sight on the zero of the scale, or the reading
noted. For a girder supposed to deflect to uniform curvature
(say, with uniform depth and uniform stress, the
ordinary case) the reading observed will be four times the
deflection; every <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inch actual reading on the scale will
correspond to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub> inch of girder deflection.</p>

<p>Apart from the deflection, this method gives a ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
means of observing the end slope, a quantity of equal value
for purposes of comparison. As with girders of similar proportions,
and similarly stressed, the deflection will at all
spans be the same fraction of the span; so should the end
slope be a constant quantity under similar conditions, the
diagram, <a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>, will make the principle quite clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig54" id="Fig54"></a><a name="Fig55" id="Fig55"></a><a name="Fig56" id="Fig56"></a><a name="Fig57" id="Fig57"></a>
<img src="images/illo104.png" alt="" width="350" height="429" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 54 to 57.</p>
</div>

<p>Strictly the character of the deflection curve is slightly
modified by that part of the deflection due to the web; so
that the depression at the centre would, in the case assumed
above, be somewhat more than one-fourth part of the end
reading, and generally will be a larger fraction of the reading
than that deduced from a consideration of flange stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
simply. In <a href="#Fig55">Figs. 55 to 57</a>, which are intended to explain
this, it will be noticed that deflection due to the web is
shown straight-lined from the bearings to the centre of the
girder; this is strictly true only for a girder correctly designed
for an immovable distributed load; but as there
should be for girders intended for a travelling load, some
excess in web members near the centre under the condition
of uniform loading, the point of the figure should be rounded
off to be in agreement with this case, though it is left as
shown in the diagram for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>Suitable constants, including the corrections necessary,
are given in column A of the table annexed for a few typical
cases, and by these constants the actual readings should be
multiplied to find the deflection. The constants have been
worked out for depths of one-tenth the span; for greater
depths they should be slightly more, and for smaller depths
somewhat less, but they may be used between the limits of
one-sixth and one-fourteenth, with a maximum error hardly
exceeding 5 per cent., and generally much less.</p>

<p>The figures in column B relate to the formul&aelig; previously
stated, and apply equally well to all depths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>It is apparent that, if preferred, the scale, instead of
being in inches, divided suitably, may, for each type of
girder, be amplified to the proper degree, so that the amount
of the deflection may be read off at once.</p>

<p>This method of dealing with deflections is quite independent
of the character of the bearings, and is applicable
to girders at any height above ground or over water; but
its use would hardly be practicable for very small beams, or
those in an awkward position, or near which it would be
impossible to remain with a running load upon the bridge.</p>

<p>There is a possible source of error in the use of the
instrument, most likely to occur with triangulated girders,
with which, if the instrument is placed at the top of an end
post, the reading observed may be the joint effect of deflection
and of local flexure of the members meeting near the
telescope. This may be tested, and, if necessary, allowed
for, by first sighting upon a scale at the next apex, and
observing the effect of the moving load. Again, as girders
sometimes cant towards the running load, if the instrument
is placed on one edge of a girder, and the cantings of the
two ends are dissimilar, a false reading will result, which
may be amended by ascertaining the amount of cant at each
end, and correcting for the effect of the difference between
the cants upon the observation. Only in exceptional cases
is it likely that either of these considerations would need
attention.</p>

<p>The author has secured with this instrument very promising
results, notwithstanding that under a running load there
is a slight haziness of the scale as seen through the telescope,
due to &#8220;dither,&#8221; largely the result of imperfections which
may be remedied.</p>

<p>Deflections may sometimes be conveniently taken, by a
quick-eyed observer, with a good surveyor&#8217;s level and a
specially-divided staff held at the centre of the girder. The
divisions preferred by the author for this purpose are <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
plainly marked, which may be seen at 50 feet distance with
sufficient clearness to make possible readings by estimation
between the divisions to, say, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> inch. But it is clearly
desirable not to rely upon a single observation only, where
all the evidence is gone so soon as the sight has been taken.</p>

<p>In rail-bearers, or other short girders, it may not be
practicable to adopt such methods, either on account of an
inability to find a suitable place for the instrument, or to
read with any telescope with sufficient promptitude as the
load passes rapidly over. The use of rods may also be out
of the question, as the errors attending their manipulation
may be serious where but a small movement has to be noted,
this being complicated in some instances by the bearings
being insecure, and working to an extent which obscures the
measurement sought. In such cases it is preferable to use
a stiff slat lying along the girder, which bears, through
short blocks over the girder bearings, upon the flanges; the
deflection is then read by direct measurement of the girder&#8217;s
depression at the centre, relative to the slat.</p>

<p>The author is, unfortunately, not able to give any precise
information on the effect of running-load as against a
load that is stationary in connection with girder deflections.
It is by no means easy in ordinary work upon a railway to
secure facilities for making such comparative tests. It may,
however, be confidently stated, as a result of such observations
as he has made, that the deflection due to a load coming
rapidly upon a bridge is, as to the main girders of, say, a
50 feet span, but little greater than that due to the same
load stationary; it may be, perhaps, 5 to 10 per cent. more.</p>

<p>It is evident that to determine the precise difference
where the quantity to be measured is so small needs apparatus
of a more delicate character than that in common use,
and the control of an engine, or engines, for the purpose of
making the special tests, conditions which on a busy line can
only be secured by special arrangements previously made.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">DECAY AND PAINTING.</span></h2>

<p>The author has collected particulars as to the amount and
rate of rusting in metallic structures which are of some
interest. In all such instances it is very necessary to note
the conditions which have obtained during the process of
wasting, as without this, misleading conclusions may be
drawn. The information given relates in all cases to wrought
iron, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>A plate-girder bridge, having girders under rails, was
found to be badly rusted. The atmospheric conditions were
unusually trying, the air being damp and impregnated with
acid fumes from adjacent steel works. That the wasting
was largely due to this latter cause was indicated by the fact
that the girders nearest to the steel works suffered more than
those farther removed and partly sheltered from the corrosive
influence.</p>

<p>The webs were in places eaten right through, having
lost a mean amount of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch full on each surface in
twenty-eight years. Painting had not been well attended to.</p>

<p>In a similar bridge, not a great distance from this, but
sufficiently far away to modify the conditions for the better,
considerable wasting was also observed, but more particularly
where the girders had been built into masonry, which,
loosening with the constant movement of the girder-ends,
had allowed moisture to collect, and rust to develop, without
the chance of repainting these surfaces. The amount of
waste at the places indicated was, as in the last case, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch on each face, and in the same time, other parts of
the girders having suffered less.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig58" id="Fig58"></a>
<img src="images/illo109.png" alt="" width="350" height="60" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 58.</p>
</div>

<p>A third plate-girder bridge, with outer main girders,
cross-girders, and plated floor, carrying a road over a railway
and sidings, and which was known to have been
neglected in the matter of painting, was very badly rusted,
both as to the cross-girders and floor-plates. The atmosphere
was somewhat damp; the chief cause of deterioration
was, however, the smoke and steam from locomotives, which
frequently stood for some time, during shunting operations,
directly under the bridge. The webs of the cross-girders,
which were originally <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch thick, had rusted into occasional
holes during fourteen years&mdash;i.e. <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch from each
surface in that time. When removed a little later the
wasting was so complete that it was possible to knock out
with a light hammer the remains of the web between flanges
and stiffeners, so as to leave an open frame only. One of
the cross-girders was so treated by the men engaged upon
the work, when it presented the appearance shown in <a href="#Fig58">Fig. 58</a>.</p>

<p>In another case&mdash;that of a bridge with lattice girders
under rails&mdash;the ends were built into masonry, which had,
of course, loosened, with the usual result. The air of the
locality was certainly pure, but somewhat damp. The general
condition of the ironwork was good, but end-bars of the
diagonal bracing, where they had been closed in, had lost
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch on each surface in thirty-three years. The top flanges
immediately under the timber floor were in a very fair state,
which is of some interest when it is considered that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
were made of steel of the same kind as that already noticed
as being used in the construction of small girders (see <a href="#Fig46">Fig.
46</a>, <i>ante</i>), described in the chapter upon &#8220;<a href="#Page_61">High Stress</a>,&#8221; both
cases dating from the year 1861. The painting upon the
lattice-girder bridge had been pretty well attended to; but
in the case of the small steel girders it had been greatly&mdash;perhaps
altogether&mdash;neglected; this, coupled with adverse
atmospheric conditions, had produced the result that the
rate of rusting had for the small girders been much greater
than that of the steel top flange referred to, being fully
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch on each surface, as against a negligible amount
under the more favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>Girder-work over sea-water, as in piers, seems to rust at
a sensibly greater rate than inland work under average conditions;
but it is hardly practicable to make any strict
comparison, as in either case the rate of oxidation is so
much affected&mdash;even controlled&mdash;by the care bestowed upon
the structures. This general conclusion is based upon the
results of examination of wrought-iron girder-work over sea-water
of ages varying from fourteen to forty-four years. It
should be remarked, however, that in one case steel girders
but five years old, and which were frequently wetted with
sea-spray, were found to be wasting rather badly&mdash;the paint
refusing to keep upon the surface.</p>

<p>It may be concluded from the above instances, and from
others which have come under notice, that wrought-iron
work, if not properly cared for in respect to painting, or
under conditions otherwise bad, may be expected to rust at
a rate which corresponds to the loss of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch on each surface
in from fifteen to thirty years; but with proper care as
to painting, and exclusive of exceptionally bad conditions,
it does not appear to waste at any measurable rate. In some
instances, upon scraping the paint from girders which had
been in use for thirty years, the author has found, beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
original red lead, the metallic surface bright and clean,
showing no trace of rust.</p>

<p>Of ordinary steelwork the same cannot be said, the common
experience being that mild steel is very liable to be
attacked by rust. With passable care in the bridge-yard
during manufacture, such that with wrought iron no after-trouble
would be noticeable, steel is very liable to show,
within a year of being built up, numerous little blisters on
the painted surface; any one of these being broken away
discloses a small rust-pit. This is more often seen on the
flange surfaces (horizontal) than on web surfaces (vertical),
but it is probable the position has little to do with the
matter, and that it is rather due to the fact that rust has
been earlier started on the flange-plates, upon being put
through the drilling-machines and inundated with slurry,
which occurs only to a more limited extent with webs having
fewer holes. The heads of steel rivets do not show this
tendency to &#8220;pit,&#8221; or to early development of rust. The
riveting is about the last operation in making a girder, each
rivet being freed of all rust by heating, and quickly coming
under the protection of oil or paint. It may happen in this
way that the heads of rivets on a girder may be exposed
without protection for as many hours only as the rest of the
work for weeks, which fully accounts for the difference in
behaviour.</p>

<p>The essential point to be observed in all steelwork is to
prevent, if possible, the first development of rust, for once
begun it is much more difficult to arrest than in iron; for
this reason, oiling of all material for a steel bridge, at a very
early stage of its existence, cannot be too strongly insisted
upon. This practice, however, makes the work so objectionable,
and even dangerous when being lifted&mdash;because of the
liability to slip&mdash;to the men engaged upon it, that it is
commonly very difficult to ensure it being done sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
soon to satisfy a careful inspector. If the work is carried
out under cover, the requirement is less urgent. Strictly,
all material should be oiled so soon as rolled, but the author
does not remember to have seen this done at any of the
mills he has visited, though it is common enough to find it
specified.</p>

<p>Ironwork does not need the extreme care which should
be bestowed upon steelwork, but it is desirable that it should
be painted as soon as possible, the surfaces being first
thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>There is, probably, for painting girder work nothing to
beat good red lead as a protective coating; but there is considerable
difficulty in getting it reasonably pure, without
which quality its utility will be greatly reduced. The question
of purity will, however, be found to be largely a question
of price. It may be stated broadly that, whether for steel
or for iron, the first protective covering is, perhaps, the most
important of any it will ever receive.</p>

<p>In repainting old work, care should be taken to remove
all traces of rust previous to laying on the new coat. It is
not an altogether uncommon practice to repaint old structures
by dealing only with the parts readily accessible, which,
being less liable to rust, probably but little need it; leaving
those parts which are difficult of access, and where rust is
developing, untouched; treating the whole business as a
matter of appearance simply. This, it need hardly be said,
is indefensible. It is better rather to neglect the surfaces
freely exposed and ventilated, and devote the whole care
upon those other parts, confined and difficult to get at;
taking the trouble necessary to remove ballast, timber, or
whatever may obstruct the operation, in order that the bad
places may be thoroughly scraped, and then painted. Those
parts which most need attention may cost, perhaps, to reach&mdash;and
deal with when exposed&mdash;ten times as much per yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of surface as the rest of the superfices, which needs little,
and is always accessible; but the cost should not deter the
proper carrying out of the work, as it will prove the very
worst sort of economy to deal with painting in a perfunctory
manner.</p>

<p>It should be noted that girder work, whether of wrought
or cast iron, when embedded in lime or cement concrete, or
mortar, generally proves to be very well preserved, provided
that close contact has obtained. Cast-iron girders, when
carrying jack arches resting upon the bottom flanges, are
found after long use to be in remarkably good order, when
finally taken out, having, indeed, the surface appearance of
new girders. Much the same remarks apply to girders of
wrought iron carrying jack arches, where protected by the
brickwork; provided that the girders are sufficiently stiff to
minimise deflection, and allow the masonry or brickwork to
adhere to the surfaces.</p>

<p>Such girders are in a very different condition to those
previously referred to, in which the ends of the girders,
carrying a light floor structure, are built into masonry where
the deflection slope is greatest; though, apart from the few
cases where adherence can be relied upon, building-in is an
undesirable practice, and has the disadvantage that after-examination
is only possible by removing portions of the
masonry, which it is evident would very seldom be resorted
to.</p>

<p>Cast iron has ordinarily&mdash;unlike wrought iron or steel&mdash;great
capacity for resisting rust, and will, after many years
of absolute neglect, appear but little the worse; an advantage
which is the more pronounced when considered relatively
to the greater thickness of the thinnest parts in
cast-iron girders, the percentage of waste being proportionately
lessened.</p>

<p>Cast iron does, however, behave somewhat badly in sea-water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the metal sometimes losing its original character, and
becoming in time quite soft; though, if not worn away, as
by the attrition of shingle, maintaining its original bulk.</p>

<p>Of some forty-five cast-iron piles belonging to various
structures, examined whilst engaged upon sea-pier work for
Mr. St. George-Moore, though the author found somewhat
diverse results, in no case did there appear to be any general
softening of the whole thickness, but a distinct change for
some definite distance inwards, generally to be decided without
difficulty, beyond which the metal appeared to retain
its original character. In all cases any material depth of
softening was found close to the ground, this depth rapidly
decreasing higher up, till, at a height of 5 feet, but little if
any softening could be detected. At 2 feet above ground
the softening was frequently but one-quarter of that at
ground level. There was, too, often a considerable difference
in the behaviour of different piles in the same structure
under similar conditions; one pile being found to have only
one-fourth part of the softening noticed in others, or possibly
none at all. For six different structures the amount of
softening near ground level, of about twenty-five piles
examined, was as given in the table on the next page.</p>

<p>The greatest depth of softening found (see No. 2) was
<sup>9</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch, 1 foot above ground, in a pile thirty-six years old.
The decayed material when removed was of a soft, greasy
consistency, perfectly black, which a few hours later was
found to have changed to a dry yellow powder, by the rapid
absorption, it may be supposed, of atmospheric oxygen. It
is apparent, therefore, from this example that deterioration
may proceed to a considerable depth; but it should be
observed that other piles of the set showed softening at
ground level of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch only.</p>

<p>The least rate of softening noticed, apart from those
structures of a more recent date, in two of which it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
very slight, occurred in a pier thirty-eight years old (No. 4),
where, of three piles tested, two were quite hard, and the
third softened <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inch only.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the precise cause of the change, it
does not appear to be affected by the period or percentage
of immersion during the rise and fall of tides.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig59" id="Fig59"></a>
<img src="images/illo116.png" alt="" width="500" height="397" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 59.</p>
</div>

<p>This will be clear from the diagram, <a href="#Fig59">Fig. 59</a>, which
refers to four piles (No. 3 of table), all of the same age, in
the same structure. On each pile the depth of softening is
given at points in strict relation to each other, and to the
tidal range. The percentages of immersion for the various
heights are also given, from a study of which it will be
apparent that these have no relation to the amount of softening;
this, indeed, is always greatest near the ground, at
whatever actual height it may be. For instance, pile A was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
at ground-level softened <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch, that point being 60 per
cent. of its life under water; but on pile B, at a point 74
per cent. of the time submerged, and 4 feet above a lower
ground-level, no softening was apparent; further, at ground-level
of this pile, the percentage being there 87, the softening
was no greater than at ground-level at pile A.</p>

<p>It is probable that while the percentage of submersion
in moving water hardly appears to affect the result, yet prolonged
contact with wet sand, sea-weed, or clinging shell-fish
may do so. This seems to suggest that the process of change,
as between the sea-water and the iron, is slow, and to be
effective must be continuous; so that it is only found to
any considerable extent where the water in contact with the
surface is still. In the two worst cases, Nos. 1 and 2 of the
table, at points 1 foot and 6 inches above ground-level,
the surface was in one pile shrouded in a thick mantle of
heavy sea-weed, and in the other covered by molluscs; in
both instances the surfaces being thus kept moist and undisturbed.
The piles of the fourth case were in hard rock,
were clean, and, where accessible, always either in moving
water or quite dry.</p>

<p>However this may be, the power to resist softening
certainly appears to vary largely with the quality of the
iron. The piles, referred to above, in which deterioration
proceeded at the most rapid rate were certainly of a soft
metal, the first being markedly so. On the other hand,
certain piles (No. 4) of hard, close-grained iron suffered very
little.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned with respect to the last named, as
a matter of interest, that the caps of the lower lengths (just
above ground-level) had been cast with short pieces of
wrought iron projecting&mdash;possibly for lifting purposes&mdash;which
during thirty-eight years had altered in character to
something very like softened cast iron, but laminated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
harder. Of about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch original thickness, only <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch
remained having the semblance of wrought iron. The
percentage of submersion was about 60.</p>

<p>A number of piles, not included in the table, varying
from fifteen to forty-four years old, and of the same structure
to which set No. 2 belonged, were all found to be hard,
with the exception of one showing <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch of softening.
These are omitted, because the mud surrounding them was
at the time of examination unusually high, so that the more
normal ground-level could not be reached, at which points
testing might have disclosed different results. It is probable
that for any piles standing in soft material examination
below the surface would reveal more pronounced softening
than where occasionally exposed.</p>

<p>To meet the effects of sea-water on cast-iron piles, and
for other reasons, it is a common and good practice to make
the lower lengths of greater thickness&mdash;say, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch more&mdash;than
that sufficient for the upper. Occasionally, also, the
bottom lengths are filled with concrete, which no doubt adds
to the length of time during which they may be relied upon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">EXAMINATION, REPAIR, AND STRENGTHENING OF
RIVETED BRIDGES.</span></h2>

<p>In the preceding chapters defects of various kinds to which
riveted bridgework is liable have been more particularly
dealt with; it is now proposed to consider the examination
of such structures, following this by a reference to methods
of repair and strengthening, leaving the treatment of other
classes of bridgework to be developed under their proper
headings, though some of the remarks immediately following
will apply to all.</p>

<p>The exhaustive survey of a bridge is only to be made
after considerable experience in the work, but it may be
stated that in looking for defects it is well to seek where they
are least expected, till, with practice, one knows better where
to direct attention. When examining with a view to pronouncing
an opinion upon the fitness of the structure to
remain in place, if in any real doubt, it is wise to give a
casting vote against it; and finally it may be said that upon
taking down a bridge condemned for any one or more defects,
it should be examined for worse. This may seem to be
somewhat pessimistic, but is based upon the teachings of
experience.</p>

<p>Preliminary examination of a bridge may reveal such
faults or weaknesses as at once to ensure its condemnation;
but if this is not the case, and there is a reasonable probability
that the structure may be given a fresh lease of life,
it will, for the purpose of estimating the strength, or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
possible repairs, commonly be desirable to secure precise
particulars of the existing structure independently of any
drawings that may be in existence, and which will very
probably be incorrect, the finished work, if old, seldom
agreeing with the contract drawings. A final decision may in
this case be deferred till after the measuring up has been
completed, the condition of the structure becoming more
familiar in the process.</p>

<p>It is desirable first to ascertain whether the bridge
remains in good form, whether the camber of girders appears
to be what might be expected, or agreeable with existing
records, though much reliance must not be placed upon
figured cambers, it being quite common for girders to leave
the bridge yards with the camber something other than
that intended. The deflections under live load will also be
observed, and compared with the calculated result, or checked
by judgment. The calculations upon which strength and
deflections are based will, of course, refer to the actual
sections, which are sometimes a little difficult to ascertain if
there has been irregular rusting. In continuous girders also,
levels having been taken, allowance should be made for
effects of settlement, if any; and with arches evidence of
movement of the piers or abutments sought for, with the
like object. It is seldom that the main flanges of girders
show signs of weakness, unless from flexure in the case of
long and narrow top members, insufficiently stiffened; but
there may be want of truth from other causes already dealt
with. In plate girders the webs should be most carefully
scanned for possible cracks, particularly where cross-girders
are connected, and along the upper edges of bottom flange
angles, if the floor rest upon the flange. All riveted connections,
of course, need close attention, both for straining
effects, where there is a liability to wracking, and to detect
loose rivets. Loose rivets and want of tightness in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
parts of the work may frequently be detected at sight by a
reddish bloom which appears on the neighbouring surfaces,
caused by rust working out and spreading under the effects
of weather; it may be seen round rivet-heads or along the
edges of angle-bars, or other parts where there is movement.
Loose rivets, though generally to be detected also by the
hammer, may perhaps in the case of thin-webbed cross-girders
be working in the web-thickness only, possibly to a
considerable extent. This, if not otherwise evident, may
sometimes be detected by simultaneous deflection tests&mdash;with
rods&mdash;at the top and bottom flanges of a girder, at the same
distance from the bearings. Any difference in the readings
may indicate loose web-rivets, or possibly a tear in the web
running parallel to the flange angles.</p>

<p>Bracings between girders are very apt to display a rich
harvest of working rivets. Cross-girders and longitudinals
also may have loose rivets at their connections, and be very
badly wasted, with quite possibly cracks in the webs, or
other defects already enlarged upon.</p>

<p>The condition of the road upon the bridge will frequently
be an indication of the state of the floor which carries it; or
the existence of rail-joints which are working badly may
very properly lead to a critical examination of the girder-work
immediately below, as this is a fruitful source of
damage in light constructions. Floor-plates, where these
exist, should be scanned for leakages, drainage nozzles, and
guttering, to see that they are free, the attachments of the
latter being often loose and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Trough floors may be expected to show loose rivets near
the ends, with a probability of excessive leakage where they
abut against the webs of supporting girders.</p>

<p>Floor plates resting upon abutments or piers, being very
liable to serious decay, require attention, and girder-work
entering masonry should receive close scrutiny, any obstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to a sufficient examination being removed so far as is
judged sufficient for the purpose. The structure should, of
course, be closely watched during the passage of live load
for any signs of abnormal movement, excessive vibration, or
lurching.</p>

<p>In addition to seeking for these various defects, or others
which have been referred to in these pages at length, it
will be well always to be alive to the possibility of faults
to be seen for the first time, or of which the author has
furnished no instance.</p>

<p>Having formed a reliable opinion as to the state of the
bridge, this, if satisfactory, may leave to be determined only
the question of strength relative to the loads carried. It is
apparent that stress limits suitable for a new structure,
which has all its life before it, of purpose moderate to cover
possible deteriorations, the growth of loads, and other adverse
influences, may to avoid immediate reconstruction, reasonably
be permitted of a higher value for a further term of
years in the case of a structure which it is known has for a
considerable period behaved well, and remains in good condition.
What this higher value may be will be greatly
influenced by the circumstances of each case, and, being
largely a matter of judgment, may be expected to vary with
different engineers. Experience shows, however, that the
nominal unit stress in an old bridge may be a very considerable
amount in excess of that allowed for new work,
without, of necessity, showing any ill effects; and the author
is of opinion that for old bridges in good condition it is
quite prudent to allow an excess of 33 per cent. beyond that
permissible for a new design. If the structure is too weak
to satisfy this modified condition, it may be possible to
bring it within the stress limit by a reduction of ballast or
other removable dead weight. If this expedient does not
promise to be satisfactory, or the bridge shows actual signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
weakness, or palpable defects, it will be necessary to deal with
the question of repair, strengthening, or reconstruction.</p>

<p>The repair of built up bridgework resolves itself largely
into a matter of replacing loose rivets by cutting these out,
rhymering the holes, if desirable, and again riveting. It
will often be sufficient to do this with no particular precautions
as to bolting up temporarily; the rivets having been
loose, may very well be spared for a time. In re-riveting
cross-girder connections it may, however, be imperative to
remove all the rivets, bolting up securely as this is done, in
order to make a tight job, taking out each bolt in turn as
required, and again filling the holes; or it may be well in a
bad case first to remove all loose rivets, substituting good
bolts, in order that work which has gone out of shape owing
to defective rivets may first be brought true.</p>

<p>Cross-girder webs, cracked vertically or nearly so, are
commonly repaired with splice-plates on either side; but in
doing this it is undesirable to add plates of excessive thickness
relative to the web&mdash;probably poor&mdash;as by an abrupt
change of web section it appears not unlikely a fresh break
may be favoured.</p>

</div>

<p>Replacing wasted flange-plates, or adding new plates to
those which exist, is occasionally resorted to in the case of
main girders, the flanges of which are sufficiently accessible,
but the operation is difficult, takes some little time, and
should only be attempted under the constant supervision of
a thoroughly capable man. When done, if the girder has
not been relieved of load by staging, the stress under full
load will be unequally distributed between the old and the
new section, the old always taking more by the amount of
the dead-load stress previously carried. The method which
the author has seen applied to lattice girders of about
80 feet span, having good angle-bars in the flanges, with a
shallow vertical web for attachment of diagonals, consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in first cutting out the old flange rivets, and substituting
bolts well screwed up, till all the rivets necessary had been
removed. The new plate length having been prepared, was,
on a Sunday, during a few hours&#8217; cessation of traffic, marked
off, the temporary bolts being removed for the purpose, and
then replaced. After the plate had been drilled, on a later
Sunday, it was finally put into position, bolted up, and
riveted at leisure; cover-plates make additional trouble, but
are dealt with on the same principle. The method as shown
in <a href="#Fig60">Fig. 60</a> is, however, barely practicable for so many plates.
It is preferable, if it is proposed to add section, to do this
with as little interference as possible with existing rivets of
importance. This may be accomplished, if the existing
plates are not too wasted at their edges, by riveting on new
strips or angle-bars (see <a href="#Fig61">Figs. 61 to 63</a>). Occasionally the
strength of a girder is increased by the addition to the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
or bottom boom of material in such a form as sensibly to
increase the depth, and thus, while adding increased section
to one boom, to reduce the stress in each, though to dissimilar
amounts. By this device also the relief is effective
only as regards the live-load stress; under dead load only
the new material does no work, provided, of course, that
no relief staging was used during the alterations. For
girders carrying any considerable proportion of dead load the
method is very inefficient, though for others, in which the
live load is relatively large, the result should be more satisfactory.</p>

<p>As this question of adding new section to old is of much
importance in dealing with repairs and strengthening operations,
a few general remarks upon the subject will be
pertinent. The difficulty in such work commonly is to
cause the new to render any considerable assistance to the
old in those cases which occur in practice. If a bar be
imagined under longitudinal stress varying between 0 and a
maximum, then, if the area of the piece be increased at the
time when it takes no stress, its capacity for resisting the
maximum amount will be increased, and for added material
of similar elasticity the unit stress proportionately reduced.
If, however, the load on the bar does not vary, the mere
addition of metal will not relieve the original section in any
degree. To take a third case, of the maximum being twice
the minimum load, it will be necessary, in order to lower the
maximum unit stress by 25 per cent., to double the original
section of the bar if, as supposed, the extra metal has been
added to the piece when under the smaller load, so that the
new section is only effective in assisting to carry the remainder
of the load at such times as it may be imposed.
The relationship stands thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula"><span class="division"><span class="num">Live load</span><span class="denom">Live + dead load</span></span> &times; <span class="division"><span class="num">New area</span><span class="denom">New + old area</span></span> = relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>These statements will be true under the conditions named,
within the elastic limit of the material; but some advantage
would be derived in the second case, and a more marked
benefit in the third, if the load assumed to be a maximum
were exceeded, or if the composite bar were tested to destruction;
as, however, these effects would be outside the
limiting conditions imposed, it must be a matter of judgment
as to how far this reserve of strength may be considered of
value.</p>

<p>If, instead of simply adding section to the bar, some part
of the constant load is put upon the new section by the
manner of attachment, the combination will, of course, be
more effective.</p>

<p>To apply these considerations and illustrate the way in
which the two methods of adding flange section work out
when reduced to figures, the case will be supposed of a girder
6 feet deep, carrying a load of which one-third is dead and
two-thirds live. To the flanges of this girder are added
plates equal to 50 per cent. of the original areas, in order to
reduce the stress of 7 tons per square inch to which the
girder before strengthening is liable, the depth remaining
substantially unaltered. With dead load only the original
section would be stressed to 2&middot;3 tons per square inch, the
new section being then unstressed. Under full load the
new and old material take 3&middot;1 tons per square inch additional,
making the modified stress on the original section
5&middot;4 tons per square inch, as against 7 tons; or a reduction
of 22 per cent. This compares with 33 per cent., the relief
due to 50 per cent. increase of flange area under ordinary
conditions of stress distribution.</p>

<p>Let the second method of strengthening the girder now
be considered, using, for purposes of comparison, the same
total amount of new material to increase the girder depth by
an addition to the top flange. This section will be equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the area of one flange, which, though it may be applied in
many different ways, giving a greater or a less increase to the
depth, would probably be used in some
such manner as that shown in <a href="#Fig64">Fig. 64</a>,
increasing the effective depth for live-load
stress by nearly 10 inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig64" id="Fig64"></a>
<img src="images/illo127.png" alt="" width="125" height="494" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 64.</p>
</div>

<p>The added material will, as in the
previous case, leave the dead-load stress
unaltered, or 2&middot;3 tons per square inch.
The stress in the bottom flange due
to live load will, however, now be 4&middot;1
tons per square inch, making a total
stress of 6&middot;4 tons per square inch,
against 7 tons&mdash;the original stress.
The reduction here is 8 per cent.
only, as compared with 12 per cent.,
the relief due, under ordinary conditions,
to an increase of effective depth
from 6 feet to 6 feet 10 inches, and by
the use of additional material, equal,
as before, to one-half of the total
flange areas before the alteration.</p>

<p>The effect on the top flange need
not be here gone into in detail, but it
may be said that, owing to the increase
of gross section and of depth,
the ultimate stresses of both the new
and old material are greatly less than
as given for the bottom flange.</p>

<p>Girders strengthened by the first
of these two methods would, it is probable,
if tested to destruction, give
results more nearly in accord with the actual percentage
increase of flange section, plastic deformation of the metal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
before failure, tending to reduce the differences of stress on
the new and old material of the sections.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig65" id="Fig65"></a><a name="Fig66" id="Fig66"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 65 and 66.</p>
</div>

<p>Web members of lattice girders may, if weak, sometimes
be dealt with by the introduction of supplementary bars,
parallel to and between the old members, or by the addition
of strips or angles to the existing diagonals. The treatment
will be largely influenced by the nature of the old detail,
which may lend itself to some one arrangement much better
than to any other.</p>

<p>End riveting of web members may, if it has become
loose, be dealt with by simply rhymering the holes a size
larger, and re-riveting in the best manner, if the stresses are
not excessive; or it may be necessary to devise some additional
attachments by which new rivets are brought into use
(see <a href="#Fig65">Figs. 65 and 66</a>). The effective relief due to supplementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
rivets will be influenced by similar considerations
to those governing increase of section.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig67" id="Fig67"></a>

</div>

<p>Old structures are very frequently deficient in bracing,
which may, in such cases, be advantageously introduced;
or girders individually weak may be rendered collectively
efficient by suitable bracing. In considering the advisability
of this, however, the case should be viewed with regard to
the possible effects of such members, as already dealt with
in the chapter relating to these questions. There it has been
pointed out that bracing between a system of parallel girders
may have the effect, under live load, of increasing the stress
on the outer girders due to twisting of the structure as a whole,
though the inner girders will, except for full loading of the
whole bridge, be advantaged as to stress values, and in any
event bettered by being held up to their work. The effect
upon the outer girders may be met by increasing their
strength, if this appears to be necessary. In all such alterations
the detail should be schemed with special care to
ensure simplicity in execution, smith&#8217;s work being rigorously
avoided. A good arrangement for supplementary bracing
between plate-girders, which gives little trouble in carrying
out, is shown in <a href="#Fig67">Fig. 67</a>; or where the stiffeners of such girders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
are in line across the bridge, the detail given in <a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a> may
involve less expenditure. Difficulties may be experienced in
riveting, unless great care is taken in the positioning of rivets.
Fitting-bolts are only to be relied upon as such, if they really
justify the name; they are, though easy to specify, by no
means easy to secure under the conditions of practical work.
Weak cross-girders may make alterations&mdash;in some cases
considerable&mdash;necessary, to rectify the defect of strength.
The removal of old girders to make room for new is seldom
resorted to, unless the existing detail renders this a simple
operation; but it is not unusual to introduce new girders
between the old in cases where there is no plated floor to
make the work difficult. By this method there is, of course,
an increase of appreciable amount in the dead load carried
by the main girders, which would in many instances be
objectionable. With deep and heavy main girders, having
plate webs, cross-girders may be strengthened by improving
the end connections by suitable gussets, and attachment to
good vertical stiffeners, the fixity of the ends thus aimed at
being assured by overhead struts or girders, from one main
girder to its fellow, at intervals apart well considered with
reference to the horizontal strength of the top flanges, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
whole thus making a closed frame, as shown in <a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a>.
The method appears feasible, but it should be stated that
the author has not known it to be applied in its entirety as
a means of strengthening an old floor.</p>

<p>A simple and very common device consists in substituting
for the ordinary cross-sleeper road, where this exists, stout
timber longitudinals under the rails, which have, where the
cross-girders do not exceed 5 feet centres, a marked distributive
effect, tending to reduce the maximum load upon any
individual girder. With a similar object, trough girders
containing longitudinal timbers are sometimes adopted where
the depth available is not enough to enable sufficiently stiff
timbers to be used alone. In either case the object sought
is the same&mdash;to modify the effect of the heavier wheel loads
upon isolated cross-girders. When the spacing is so close
as 4 feet, the beneficial result of this treatment is considerable,
but at 8 feet centres it can have but a moderate effect
where timbers alone are used.</p>

<p>Occasionally, for long cross-girders, a distributing girder
is placed, with the same intent, in the 6 feet way, its function
being limited to this use only if the depth and strength are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sufficiently small to serve this object alone, as distinct from
the case in which it becomes a carrying girder transferring
load to the abutments. As a distributor simply, the girder
has to equalise the bending moments amongst the cross-girders,
to effect which it will be evident that these moments
having been ascertained for the several cross-girders previous
to alteration, for a position of the wheel loads such that the
heaviest comes upon a centre cross-girder, the mean of these
moments will, when compared with that for each girder,
show the difference to be induced as a result of introducing
the distributor. These differences of moment render necessary
at the centre of the cross-girders reactions upwards
or downwards, as the case may be, of amounts competent
to induce moments below the inner rails equal to these
differences.</p>

<p>It is these reactions which must be provided by the distributing
girder at a moderate stress, and without flexure of
such an amount as sensibly to modify the reactions. The
greatest section necessary at any one point may then be
adopted for the girder throughout. The result will commonly
work out to a moderate section, but there will be no
harm in a little excess in a case of this kind, the total cost
being but little affected by some small addition to the weight,
where labour upon the site is so considerable an item as in
work of this description. The ends of the distributing girder
should be carried on to the abutments or piers to ensure
adequate relief of the end cross-girders. It will be found
desirable in arranging for distributing girders to ascertain at
an early stage, by boning or by levelling, the condition of
the cross-girders as to uniformity of heights, as this may affect
the length most suitable for separate sections. Between the
underside of the distributor and the cross-girder tops there
will commonly be spaces of varying amounts, which should
be filled by packings to fit, rather than by pulling the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
together by force, introducing undesirable stresses of uncertain
amount.</p>

<p>In the earlier remarks upon the strengthening of bridgework
by the use of new material, it has been assumed that
the modulus of elasticity of the new metal is similar to that
of the old; it may, however, as in cases where wrought-iron
work is reinforced by additions in steel, be necessary to
take the difference of elastic properties into account, with
which object the new section should be multiplied by a
quantity (greater or less than unity) inversely proportional to
the higher or lower modulus of the new material, that is to
say, by</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">STRENGTHENING OF RIVETED BRIDGES BY CENTRE
GIRDERS.</span></h2>

<p>The addition of distributing girders, described in the last
chapter, as a means of strengthening a bridge floor, while
sufficient in many cases so far as the cross-girders are concerned,
does not in any appreciable way assist the main
girders. When for a two-line bridge, having outer main
girders only, this result also is desired, together with a more
complete relief of the floor structure, centre main girders
may be used, placed either above or below the cross-girders,
on the centre line of the bridge.</p>

<p>There are two principal ways in which such a girder may
be brought into use; the easier, but generally less economical,
is by making a simple attachment to the cross-girders,
the old girder work still taking the whole dead load. By this
method the new girder does no work but carry itself till the
live load comes upon the bridge, and must be made very
stiff to take any sensible portion of the running load; the
second method is to make the connection adjustable, so that
a part of the floor weights may be imposed upon the new
girder as an initial load. In doing this the old outer girders
will rise slightly, being relieved of stress, and the cross-girders
also lifted at the middle, whilst the new girder is
depressed as the load is brought upon it. With some part
of the live load a very considerable proportion of the total
may in this way be carried by a centre girder of moderate
section. The whole question, by either method, turns upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
deflections; and it is in determining the relative movements
of the girders that the problem chiefly lies.</p>

<p>It is convenient first to determine the percentage of load
relief to be effected in the main girders, as to which it is to
be observed that as this relief (distributed) is induced by
the upward reaction of the new girder acting at the centre
of the cross-girders, the stress relief of these will, as a rule,
greatly exceed that of the outside girders. For the generality
of cases, it may be taken that the relief suitable for the
outside girders will be satisfactory in its effects upon the
cross-girders, even though it is desired to reduce the stress
in these to a greater degree.</p>

<p>If, however, it be thought desirable to check this, it may
be done by considering a cross-girder subject to its dead and
live loads acting downwards, and to reactions at the centre
and ends. At the centre the reaction will be the load of
which the two main girders are relieved on a length equal to
the pitch of the cross-girders, or as here given<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="numform"><a name="Form1" id="Form1"></a><span class="formula"><i>c</i> &times; <i>t</i> &times; P = reaction at centre</span>
<span class="number">(1)</span></p>

<p><i>c</i> being the percentage of relief; <i>t</i> the total load per foot run
of the bridge; and P the pitch of cross-girders. The live
loads carried by the cross-girders are for this purpose taken
at per foot run, as for the main girders. With these data
it will be easy to construct a diagram of moments, making
it evident whether the relief proposed for the main girders
will give a sufficient percentage of relief to the floor beams.</p>

<p>Granting that this proportion has been decided, and
dealing first with the case in which the centre girder is
simply attached to the cross-girders, and takes no dead load
other than its own weight, then the live load carried by the
outside girders, and previously borne wholly by them, will
be reduced by the amount it is intended to transfer to the
centre girder, and will become</p>

<p class="numform"><a name="Form2" id="Form2"></a><span class="formula">L<sub class="lg"><i>l</i></sub> - (<i>c</i> &times; L<sub class="lg"><i>t</i></sub>) = live load on outer girders</span>
<span class="number">(2)</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>L<sub class="lg"><i>l</i></sub> being the total live load, and L<sub class="lg"><i>t</i></sub> the total dead and live
load carried by the bridge. From this the deflection of the
outer girders corresponding to this modified live load may
be derived.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig70" id="Fig70"></a>
<img src="images/illo136.png" alt="" width="550" height="251" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 70.</p>
</div>

<p>It is next necessary to ascertain the vertical movement,
commonly a depression, of the cross-girders at the centre
relative to their ends, when subject to the running load only,
and supported at the middle and ends, the centre reaction
being obtained as before indicated <a href="#Form1">(1)</a>. This movement
will be the difference (if any) between the deflection on the
whole span of the cross-girder due to the live load, and the
upward flexure of the girder due to the centre reaction,
considered as separate effects. Stress values having been
estimated for the two conditions, these results may readily
be deduced by simple flexure formul&aelig;, observing that while
the curve of moments due to live load sufficiently approximates
to that for a distributed load to justify, for this, the
use of a distributed load formula as given in the chapter
&#8220;<a href="#Page_85">Deflections</a>,&#8221; the flexure due to the centre reaction will be
but 0&middot;80 of that which corresponds to the same stress for
distributed loading. Or, the curve assumed by the girder
under live load may be plotted by a method to be later
explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The sum of the movements now determined&mdash;that is,
the live-load deflection of the outer girders, and depression,
as is commonly the case, of the cross-girders&mdash;will give the
extreme depression (marked <i>m</i> in <a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a>), from the dead-load
condition of the middle cross-girders, when supported
to the extent desired by a centre girder whose proportions are
not yet known, but which, carrying the required percentage
of the total load, must, subject to a reservation presently
stated, deflect only this amount. The unit stress in the
flanges of the new girder, governed by this flexure, will for
a plate girder be</p>

<p class="numform"><a name="Form3" id="Form3"></a><span class="formula"><span class="division"><span class="num">D &times; C &times; <i>m</i></span>
<span class="denom">S<sup>2</sup></span></span> = <i>f</i>, unit stress on gross section</span>
<span class="number_up">(3)</span></p>

<p>D and S being, as before (see &#8220;<a href="#Page_85">Deflections</a>&#8221;), the depth and
span respectively in feet, C a constant, <i>m</i> the deflection in
inches, and <i>f</i> the stress per square inch on the gross section
of flange.</p>

<p>The gross area A, of the flange, is given by</p>

<p class="numform"><a name="Form4" id="Form4"></a><span class="formula"><span class="division"><span class="num">S &times; <i>c</i> &times; L<sub class="lg"><i>t</i></sub></span>
<span class="denom">8 &times; D &times; <i>f</i></span></span> = gross area of flange</span><span class="number_up">(4)</span></p>

<p><i>c</i> &times; L<sub class="lg"><i>t</i></sub>, being, as in <a href="#Form2">(2)</a>, the load transferred to and carried
by the centre girder.</p>

<p>The actual stress in the flanges will, of course, be greater
by an amount due to the girder&#8217;s own weight; but this does
not affect the question of relief. For any ordinary case the
stress per square inch will be low; but it will manifestly be
useless to assume a greater stress with a view to economy, as
the effect of reducing the section will simply be to make the
girder too flexible, thus causing it to be less effective than
primarily intended. If, as is seldom the case, there is
freedom as to the depth of girder permissible, it is evident
the unit stress may be made a condition, and the depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
deduced by a suitable modification of formula <a href="#Form3">(3)</a>; the
relief desired being in this way equally well assured. Indeed,
in the rare instances in which any depth may be
adopted, this method is&mdash;contrary to the general rule&mdash;distinctly
economical, particularly if the girder may be placed
below the cross-girders, which simply rest upon it, without
elaborate attachments.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig71" id="Fig71"></a>
<img src="images/illo138.png" alt="" width="550" height="259" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 71.</p>
</div>

<p>Considering now the second method of applying centre
girders by which the new girder is made initially to carry
part of the dead load, by adjustment, it will at once be
recognised as a more complex matter. The measure of
relief by which the old girderwork shall benefit need not
be affected by the method of applying the centre girder,
and may be decided on the principles already considered.
The outer girders carrying a reduced load, when the bridge
is fully loaded, and the cross-girders being in part supported
at their centres in the manner already described, will give a
resulting depression <i>m</i> (see <a href="#Fig71">Fig. 71</a>) of the centre cross-girders,
below the original dead-load position, of a similar
amount determined in the same way. This extreme depression
determines also the lowest position of the new centre
girder, which may be designed to carry the required percentage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of the total bridge loads with the maximum stress
and depth, as conditions, leaving the initial dead load and
necessary adjustments to be ascertained. This is the common
case and will be here dealt with, it being assumed to avoid
ambiguity in description that the new girder lies above the
cross-girders.</p>

<p>The centre girder of fixed depth being then required to
carry a definite load at a definite flange stress, will deflect a
definite amount at this stress. If this deflection equalled
the extreme depression <i>m</i> of the old girder work, no adjustment
would be necessary, the centre girder then carrying no
initial dead load, as by the first method; but for centre
girders designed for economical flange stress the deflection will
in ordinary cases greatly exceed this, the depth generally
being small, and in order to ensure that the new girder shall
do its full work, some dead load must be put upon it. In the
act of adjustment the cross-girders must be lifted and the
centre girder depressed, till the joint movement equals the
excess <i>s</i> of the centre girder deflection over <i>m</i>, when the
new girder will carry the proper amount of initial load, and
upon further deflection under live load give the full measure
of relief. The amount of &#8220;lift&#8221; or upward flexure of the
old girder work, and the depression or &#8220;drop&#8221; of the new
girder, during adjustment, will depend upon relative stiffness,
and may be ascertained as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>For unit reactions at the centre of the cross-girders the
upward flexure of these may be ascertained, as also the
upward flexure of the two outer girders when subject to
forces of the same total amount (one-half to each) applied
at the cross-girder ends. The sum of these movements will
give the total lift of the centre cross-girders, when all are
subject to unit lifting forces; similarly, the depression of
the centre girder for unit loads applied at the cross-girders
may be determined. There will then be known the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
upwards and downwards of the old and new work
when being drawn together by unit forces applied as stated.</p>

</div>

<p>The act of adjustment may conveniently be effected by
the arrangement shown in <a href="#Fig72">Fig. 72</a>, in which each cross-girder
is hung up at its centre by four bolts. At the middle of
the centre girder the total amount to be screwed up will be
that corresponding to the deflection excess <i>s</i>, but towards
the ends this amount decreases, and may advantageously be
represented by a diagram as <a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>, in which, if <i>s</i> represents
to scale the amount to be screwed up at a centre cross-girder,
the corresponding amounts for other girders may be read off
direct. It will be apparent that it must be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
place the centre girder at such a height as to leave a space
between the old and the new work greater than the amount
to be screwed up, this excess clearance being ultimately filled
by a packing.</p>

<p>The precautions to be observed in carrying out this
kind of work, and the practical methods of adjustment
adopted by the author after some little experience, may here
be given.</p>

<p>Great care is necessary at the outset to ascertain the true
spacing of the cross-girders, to ensure that the bolt-holes in
the bottom flange of the centre girder shall come where
desired. The fixing of the cross-girder brackets also needs
close attention to avoid after trouble, the bolt-holes in the
brackets being preferably drilled on the site after fixing.
It will, for masonry abutments, be necessary to fix bedstones
to receive the new centre girder, which, being carried out
quite possibly under adverse traffic conditions, will perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
leave the stones liable to settle slightly when the full load
is carried. To eliminate the bad effect of this upon the
ultimate adjustment, and to take up any initial set of the
new girder work, which would be prejudicial in the same
way, it is desirable, the centre girder being in place, to screw
up the bolts temporarily and leave the work for a week
or two. To ensure regularity in the screwing up process, it
is convenient to prepare, for use at the bridge, a diagram
somewhat similar to <a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>, giving the amount by which
the new and old work are to be brought together at each
cross-girder, with the number of turns for each nut to effect
this. With a man at each side of the girder, the whole
length is traversed, giving a half-turn to each nut; this is
repeated as often as necessary, and so managed as to bring
all up proportionately to the final requirement, keeping tally
with chalk marks over each cross-girder as a check. The
preliminary screwing up should be conducted with little less
care than that adopted for the later adjustment, to avoid
damage to the old work. This later adjustment having in
due course been effected, it is then necessary to measure for
packings to fill the spaces remaining between the old cross-girders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and the new centre girder. These spaces should be
callipered at each of the four corners, care being taken to
avoid after-confusion. The measurements ascertained will,
however, be too great for the finished packings, as an allowance
of not less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inch (total), will commonly be
wanted to cover irregularities in the surfaces. The packings,
having been prepared and checked, may be slipped into
place after slacking all the bolts a small amount to permit
this to be done, finally screwing up tight and securing
the nuts by split-pins, through holes drilled as the last
operation.</p>

<p>As a check upon the calculations and adjustment, the
&#8220;lift&#8221; of the outer girders and cross-girders, and the &#8220;drop&#8221;
of the centre girder may be observed by levelling. For this
purpose the author has used a staff of inches divided into
tenths, with which, and a good level, very accurate readings
may be taken for short distances.</p>

<p>No reference has been made to the effect of skew in a
bridge on the above methods, the explanation given applying
rather to bridges square on plan. The influence of skew on
the load distribution will largely be a matter of detailed
calculation. The flexure of the girders may also be sensibly
affected, but may be arrived at with sufficient accuracy
without any great trouble. The chief effect of skew is to
modify the amount of screwing up during adjustment, which
may be better understood by reference to <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 74</a>, and comparing
it with <a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>, the adjustment diagram for a square
bridge.</p>

<p>To illustrate how these methods of strengthening work
out, and compare as to weights of centre girders required,
the case has been assumed of a wrought iron bridge of 60-feet
span, having outer girders 5 feet deep, of 39 square inches
gross flange area; and cross-girders, at 8-feet centres, 27-feet
span, 1 foot 9 inches deep, with a gross flange area of twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
square inches. The dead load and live load on either road
are each 1&middot;75 tons per foot run.</p>

<p>The stress in the outer girders previous to the alteration
being 6 tons per square inch gross, it is desired to relieve
this to the extent of 33 per cent. by a steel centre girder.

<p>Girders subject to distributed load are treated as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
uniform stress, but where this is not strictly the case, as in
some light girders, it will be necessary to take the fact into
account. For centre girders of wrought iron, and a unit
stress on the gross section of 4 instead of 5 tons, the girder
weights are between 9 and 10 per cent. greater.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig74" id="Fig74"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 74.</p>
</div>

<p>In the above treatment of the application of centre
strengthening girders there is a source of error which should
be touched upon. If, under live load, the centre girder
deflects more than the outer girders, as it commonly will,
there must be a want of uniformity in the behaviour of the
cross-girders, those near the abutments being more relieved
than the estimated amount of relief of those at the centre,
which will have less than that intended; but the reduction
of stress in the cross-girders will generally be so considerable
that any such ambiguity of excess or defect is commonly
unimportant; the effect of this also upon the main girders
is much less than might be supposed, being, for the third of
the cases just given, about 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent. excess for the centre
girder, and generally a much smaller error. With this
qualification, the method can, however, be regarded as
approximate only. It is possible to eliminate some part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the error by lifting the end cross-girders during adjustment,
a less amount than that given by the diagrams, <a href="#Fig73">Figs. 73</a> and
<a href="#Fig74">74</a>, taking care that the centre girder is depressed its full
amount by lifting the centre cross-girders a little more; this
refinement is hardly necessary, and unless controlled by
calculation cannot be depended upon for precise results.</p>

<p>Particulars are here given of five ordinary cases, comparing
the calculated and observed results of adjustment. The
operation of levelling was conducted by a quick-eyed and
capable assistant, who was not made acquainted with the
results expected, in order to avoid any sub-conscious tendency
to match the calculated figures<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The method of calculation adopted for these cases was
not precisely that given, though depending upon the same
broad principles. The first cannot be considered a good
example. The last, having continuous girders, of course
needed special treatment.</p>

<p>Of about seventeen bridges strengthened in the manner
described, the effect generally was satisfactory, in reducing
deflection and vibration; but in two cases of small span,
owing probably to settlement of bedstones, the results were
not so good.</p>

<p>From first to last the work of putting in a centre girder
takes some little time, owing to the slow progress generally
made in fixing the brackets, preparing packings, etc. The
cost of a typical case was about 23 per cent. of the cost of a
new superstructure, with a 30 per cent. relief of stress.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig75" id="Fig75"></a>

<p>A special case of strengthening by a centre girder, having
considerable interest, may be here referred to. The primary
idea involved was not the author&#8217;s. The bridge dealt with
has already been noticed under &#8220;<a href="#Page_34">Bracing</a>&#8221; and a section,
before alteration, shown in <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>. The span being 85
feet, there was no room for a centre girder of sufficient depth
above the cross-girders and between the roads, nor was it
considered economical to place the girder wholly below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
floor, because of the costly staging this would have necessitated
for erection purposes, the height above ground level
being very great. A girder was therefore designed, having
open latticing at an angle of 60 degrees, with a bottom boom
to be below the cross-girders, the top being as high above
the rails as could be permitted (see <a href="#Fig75">Figs. 75</a> and <a href="#Fig76">76</a>). A
temporary boom was arranged at the intersection of diagonals,
the lower boom proper not being fixed till the girder
having been lifted into place, with the diagonal members
passing between the cross-girders, allowed this to be done.
The girder for some time carried itself from bearing to bearing,
with the temporary boom in tension, the deflection being
then 2 inches. The permanent boom was then put in place,
and the girder restored as nearly as was practicable to the
camber it was intended to have when complete, but without
throwing, during the process, any improper loads upon the
old work.</p>

<p>The lower boom being finally riveted up, the cross-girders
were made to bear upon it by suitable packings. There
were, in addition to the new girder, two stiff frames between
the old main girders, to which the new was secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The girder was designed with the intention that under
dead load only the cross-girders should just rest, but throw
no weight, upon the new work, the latter assisting to carry
live load only. The floor beams being of small span, and
securely riveted to the old girder tops, the centre girder was
required to deflect, under its share of live load, the same
amount as the old main girders under the remaining portion,
the three points of support of the cross-girders thus not
altering their relative levels. That this resulted was evident
from the fact that, previous to connecting the cross-frames
to the centre-girder, the work being otherwise complete, a
space between the two of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, afterwards filled by
a packing, showed no alteration, the closest measurement
failing to disclose any relative movement upon the passage
of live load. The reduction of vibration was, as might be
expected, very marked.</p>

<p>In the conduct of that class of strengthening work which
has been dealt with in this chapter, it is essential, in the
author&#8217;s judgment, that the man responsible for the detailed
calculations and design should himself see the operations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
adjustment carried out, or delegate it only to one equally
familiar with the requirements.</p>

<p>Before dismissing the subject, it will be well to refer to
a method of approximately determining flexure curves, of
occasional use in dealing with centre girder or similar questions.
The figure assumed is plotted to an exaggerated scale,
with which object the actual radius of curvature at points
along the girder&#8217;s length are first ascertained by the formula</p>

<p class="formula"><span class="division"><span class="num">E &times; D</span><span class="denom"><i>f</i> &times; 2</span></span> = R, radius of curvature in feet,<br />
</p>

<p>and the radius of curvature for the diagram by</p>

<p class="numform"><a name="Form5" id="Form5"></a><span class="formula">12 &times; R &times; F<sup>2</sup> = <i>r</i>, radius for plotting, in inches</span>
<span class="number">(5)</span></p>

<p>E being the modulus of elasticity, D the girder&#8217;s depth in
feet, <i>f</i> the mean of the extreme flange stresses per square
inch of gross area, and F the fraction indicating scale as <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>48</sub>,
where <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch = 1 foot. The curve, being plotted, shows by
direct scaling the movement of any point relative to its
original position. Near the ends of the curve where the
radii may be of considerable length, the arcs may be drawn
with the help of template curves, or even set out as pieces of
&#8220;straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the curve is laid down so that its chord equals the
span to scale, the method involves an error of excess in the
resulting deflection or droop which is as much as 7 per cent.
when the mean radius for plotting equals the span as drawn,
or when the droop of curve approaches one-eighth of the
span. As the exaggeration of curvature is made less pronounced,
this error rapidly diminishes, till for a droop of
about one-sixteenth the percentage is one-fourth part of that
above given. This excess in the droop of curve may be
amended by the following expression<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula">droop - <span class="fsize150">(</span><span class="division"><span class="num">droop<sup>3</sup></span><span class="denom">chord<sup>2</sup></span></span>
&times; 3&middot;73<span class="fsize150">)</span> = corrected droop, or deflection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>For some purposes it may be preferable to amend the
radii for plotting, so that the curve, as laid down, shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
correct, which may be effected by the formula here given, to
be applied to each value of r, as first ascertained<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula"><i>r</i> + <span class="fsize150">(</span><span class="division"><span class="num">chord<sup>2</sup></span>
<span class="denom"><i>r</i></span></span> &times; &middot;0625<span class="fsize150">)</span> = corrected plotting radius.</p>

<p>If, however, the length of curve is made equal to the
span (the chord then being less), and the radii for plotting
as given by <a href="#Form5">(5)</a> are used, the result will for most purposes
be sufficiently precise, though there will now be an error of
a contrary kind, which, for a curve having a droop of one-eighth,
will be about 2 per cent. too little. A somewhat
similar method of setting out deflection curves is described
by Professor Fleeming Jenkin in the article &#8220;Bridges&#8221; of
the &#8220;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&#8221; but without corrections.</p>

<p>A careful comparison of results by the above means, with
those calculated, shows that with good draughtsmanship they
may be relied upon for considerable accuracy. Equally
applicable to girders of varying depth and flange stress,
they have also a limited use in cases of continuity.</p>

amount. As a matter of convenience, each radius length
has been halved, before correction, so that the resulting
droop of the curve is twice the true amount.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">CAST-IRON BRIDGES.</span></h2>

<p>Cast Iron as a material for bridges has of late years fallen
into disrepute. It is now entirely tabooed by the Board of
Trade for railway under-bridges, unless of arched construction.
This condemnation of cast iron followed, and was
apparently the result of, an accident which occurred to an
under-bridge on one of the southern lines, which bridge had
already earned for itself an ill repute by breaking down on a
previous occasion. The ultimate issue was, however, good,
inasmuch as it led to a thorough overhaul of all railway
under-bridges in this country, and the renewal of a great
number no longer in a condition suited to the carriage of
heavy or of passenger traffic; yet there is little doubt
that, in the author&#8217;s judgment, many excellent cast-iron
bridges were then removed at considerable cost, to be replaced
by others of wrought iron or steel, which will not last
so long as many of those displaced had done, or would still
have lasted had they not been dismantled.</p>

<p>The earlier cast-iron bridges were commonly made of
cold-blast iron, a material of such strength and toughness as
to give an extraordinary amount of trouble in breaking up
the heavier parts, when the time arrived to do this, and with
which material ordinary hot-blast iron is not to be compared
for reliability.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig79" id="Fig79"></a>
<img src="images/illo154.png" alt="" width="500" height="186" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 79.</p>
</div>

<p>As illustrating the very considerable stress to which cast
iron may be subjected, without of necessity leading to any
mishap, two cases may be cited. The first, a bridge of 32<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
feet effective span, carrying two lines of way, each pair of
rails being supported upon Barlow rails, forming the bridge
floor, the ends resting upon the bottom flanges of inverted
<span class="lettsymb">T</span>-shaped girders, 2 feet 3 inches deep, as shown in <a href="#Fig79">Fig. 79</a>.</p>

<p>The extreme fibre stress works out at 2&middot;9 tons per square
inch in tension, and 5&middot;9 tons per square inch compression,
calculated as it would be in ordinary office work; but for
the actual loads, at a span as above, exceeding the clear span
by 6 inches only, and without regard to the effects of eccentric
application of the load. The girders when taken out showed
upon examination no sign of overstrain. The practice of
loading cast-iron girders in this manner cannot, however, be
too strongly condemned, notwithstanding that in this case no
ill resulted. It is evident that a piece of the lower flange
being broken out from this cause, as occasionally happens,
might so reduce the section as to result in complete failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig80" id="Fig80"></a><a name="Fig81" id="Fig81"></a>
<img src="images/illo155.png" alt="" width="500" height="382" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 80 and 81.</p>
</div>

<p>The second example is that of a small railway under-bridge
of two spans, continuous over the central pier, each
span being 16 feet 6 inches. The rails were supported upon
longitudinal timbers lying within trough-shaped girders, as
shown in <a href="#Fig80">Figs 80 and 81</a>.</p>

<p>The stress over the pier, in the extreme fibres of the top
flange, is estimated at 4&middot;7 tons per square inch in tension,
but it should be noted that the effect of the timber longitudinal
and rail has been neglected in arriving at this result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which might possibly on this account be reduced to near
3 tons per square inch.</p>

<p>The case is noticeable because no evidence of high stress
was apparent. The author saw nothing to suggest sinking
of the central pier, the effect of which, within limits, would
be to further reduce the stress as calculated; but it is quite
possible some slight settlement had occurred; this, as the
spans were so small, would have a sensible effect. While too
much reliance should not, it is clear, be placed upon any
estimated result about which there is a lingering doubt, it
should be remarked that, as it would be necessary the pier
should sink <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> of an inch, for each ton of reduced stress, it
is not probable that the results quoted are in excess to any
material degree; they are, indeed, more probably low, as no
notice has been taken of impact.</p>

<p>Though cast-iron girders for railway under-bridges are
now prohibited in this country for new works, there are still
uses to which they may be applied, and it may be well to
insist that girders of this material should be fairly loaded, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
weight being brought upon them in such a way that there
shall be no serious secondary stress, such as arises when wide
flanges are made to carry concentrated loads; the author has,
indeed, met with no instance of a cast-iron girder breaking
down under a load fairly applied. Preference is now given
to steel or wrought iron for columns; while this is often
quite justifiable, there remain many cases in which nothing
better need be desired for this purpose than good cast iron,
provided only that the column be loaded in a suitable
manner&mdash;i.e., axially, and that the arrangement and details
of the super-structure are such that there shall be no cross-breaking
efforts, or rocking of the column due to temperature
or other causes; unless, indeed, such cross-breaking or
rocking is definitely taken into account in designing the work.
The same care observed in the detailing of cast-iron work
that is not infrequently taken in the design of structures
made of rolled sections would, in suitable cases, the author
has no doubt, yield results just as reliable in practice, with
the advantage of greater resistance to rust, and a reduced
cost in maintenance.</p>

<p>Good cast iron is, in fact, when used with discretion, a
most excellent material, popular predjudice notwithstanding.
The oldest metallic bridge in this country at the present
moment is of that metal.</p>

<p>The one chief respect in which cast iron is at a disadvantage
compared with wrought iron or steel is that it does not
give premonitory warning of failure&mdash;it remains intact, or it
breaks. The indications of weakness, which may be read by
an experienced inspector of other metallic bridges, are in
a great measure absent. There is also an objection which
may exist, but is to be avoided by good design and care in
the foundry&mdash;viz., internal stress due to unequal cooling.
In extreme cases this may lead to fracture before the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
has left the maker&#8217;s hands, but it can only occur by neglect
of ordinary precautions.</p>

<p>In a case which has already been referred to in the
chapter on &#8220;<a href="#Page_73">Deformations</a>,&#8221; <a href="#Page_80">page 80</a>, an outer rib of a
cast-iron arch fractured near the crown after fifty-four years&#8217;
use. Owing to the nature of the design, and the fact that
the near abutment had closed in slightly, bringing the linear
arch of necessity near the lower edges of the arch segment
in question, it was possible to estimate, with a probability of
truth, the extreme fibre stress (tensile) due to the load forces,
at the upper edge where fracture commenced. The result
was very far from explaining the occurrence of the break,
but an examination of the details shown in <a href="#Fig82">Figs. 82 and 83</a>
will make it apparent that, in addition to the tensile stress, as
calculated, there was probably a severe initial stress of the
same character due to irregular cooling in the foundry half a
century before. The sum of these stresses, it is suggested,
placed this particular casting in a critical condition, such
that operations in the construction of a new bridge adjacent
either by producing a small further settlement of the foundations,
of which the author saw no evidence, or, as is more
probable, the attachment of a rope to this rib for the purpose
of keeping a barge in position, which certainly did occur,
gave the arch rib just such an additional strain as to result
in the break shown, though no one of these causes acting
singly would have been sufficient to induce fracture. The
inner ribs were of a much less objectionable section.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig84" id="Fig84"></a>
<img src="images/illo158b.png" alt="" width="550" height="182" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 84.</p>
</div>

<p>Cast-iron arches, though still allowed by the Board of
Trade rules, are, indeed, liable to be seriously affected by
settlement, or yielding of the abutments, unless hinges at the
crown are introduced. As an instance of this may be quoted
a bridge of some 45 feet span, in which the arches were cast
in two pieces abutting, and very efficiently bolted together at
the crown, the springing and vertical abutment member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the spandrel being bolted and built solidly into heavy
masonry. The arch sank at the crown, caused by, or itself
the cause of, a movement of the abutment, with the result
that the lower bolts at the crown joint broke away, rupturing
the casting, as shown in <a href="#Fig84">Fig. 84</a>. The arch must then have
acted as though hinged at the crown, as effectiveness of the
connection was destroyed. It had been better, evidently, if
a proper hinge had originally been provided. The break
happened to occur so as to leave a sufficiently good bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
face at the crown; there was, indeed, no tendency for one
surface to slide upon another; but in the accidental fracture
of cast iron this cannot be assured, and the liability to it is
a risk which should be eliminated if possible.</p>

<p>A second case of very much the same character has also
been under the author&#8217;s observation, though in this the ends
of the spandrels were not built into the brickwork of which
the abutments were composed. Other instances of fracture
either in the arch proper or in the spandrel work, have come
under notice, though particulars cannot now be adduced;
but the examples cited are by themselves sufficient to justify
the conclusion that it is imprudent to construct a cast-iron
arch without a central pin or its equivalent, unless the abutments,
being exceptionally well founded, may be relied upon
as free from any liability to move. It is, however, to be
borne in mind that movement in the abutments of a small
arch of any given absolute amount is more injurious than the
same amount of movement in the abutments of large arches
of similar design, so that what may be negligible in the latter
case would perhaps be destructive in the former.</p>

<p>To the absence of ductility and liability to initial stress
must be added yet another disadvantage to which cast-iron
work is prone&mdash;viz., the possibility of concealed defects,
blow-holes or cold-shuts; these in good foundry practice are
not very likely to occur, but, as they are possible, cannot
be overlooked in considering the suitability of cast iron for
bridgework, or, indeed, any structural work liable to serious
stress, and particularly tensile stress. With these remarks
by way of qualification, the author reiterates his opinion that
there is still a use for cast iron in bridgework.</p>

<p>With respect to the repair of cast-iron bridges, but little
is to be said; the possibilities in this direction are very
limited. Occasionally it may be desired to deal with the
fracture of some member in the spandrel bracing of an arch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
when it is commonly sufficient, and even preferable, to limit
the repair work to confining the fractured parts in such a
way as to prevent displacement.</p>

<p>Rarely it may happen that an arch fractures as a result
of settlement, or other movement, when, if it is decided that
safety of the structure is not imperilled, it will in this case
also be preferable to confine the parts simply by flitch-plates
or other contrivance, with no attempt rigidly to make good
the break, the consequences of which treatment would
probably be to induce fracture in some other place. Effective
strengthening of a cast-iron structure is seldom practicable,
though something may occasionally be done by the
negative process of lightening the dead load, or by remodelling
the permanent way. Arches may, however, be
rendered much more reliable by the introduction of suitable
bracing where this is either wanting or inefficient.</p>

<p>In scheming such additions it is desirable to arrange for
as little drilling of the old work as is possible; where this
cannot be altogether avoided, the position of the holes should
be carefully chosen with regard to the effect they may have
upon the strength of the old work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">TIMBER BRIDGES.</span></h2>

<p>Timber bridges, though probably the most ancient in
type, are yet the least durable in any particular instance.
The perishable nature of the material when used for exposed
construction renders it peculiarly liable to develop defects
which quickly put a limit to the life of the structure. In
addition to decay in the body of the main members&mdash;which
may perhaps be long delayed, so that a simple beam bridge
may last for many years&mdash;there is in more complex designs
decay at connections and joints, which proves very detrimental
to the integrity of the whole. Water running upon
the surface of a member gravitates to its lower end, and, if
there be a joint or other connection, settles there, to be productive
of lasting mischief. From this cause, together with
a very common deficiency of bearing surface relative to the
forces to be met, the joints soon develop some movement;
working of the structure commences under passing loads, its
final destruction being then a question of time only. Each
joint is, in fact, in timber bridge construction a source of
serious weakness to a degree which has no parallel in well-designed
metallic bridges.</p>

<p>Wrought-iron straps to confine the ends of raking
members, or for other uses, are liable to crush into the wood,
and bolts are apt to enlarge the hole through which they
pass. Wood keys, where these are introduced to prevent one
timber from sliding upon another, are also prone to develop
cracks in the main members, and fibre crippling from excess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of stress. All these defects are, however, in timber-work
more easily defined than efficiently remedied, as it is barely
practicable for any but the harder woods to ensure, for heavy
loads, a sufficiency of bearing surfaces.</p>

<p>The most readily detected evidence of deterioration in
timber bridges is the sag of its bearing members, or trusses,
for the simple reason that if there is no local trouble at the
joints, there will probably be no appreciable drop at the
centre of the span. The existence of such a depression
may, however, be caused in rare instances by the spread
of the supporting piers or abutments, particularly in
the case of beams trussed by end diagonal rakers and
having no tie.</p>

<p>Bridges formed of deep trusses, with the road upon the
top, are sometimes found to be wanting in lateral bracing,
the result of which is that the main trusses go out of line,
leaning considerably one way or the other, being checked
only by such rigidity as the joints and floor-beam attachments
may have, with possibly some assistance from the end connections
of the span.</p>

<p>The decay of piles where entering the ground or water
is, of course, a fruitful source of trouble, as also is the sinking
of piles, where these are insufficient in number, or have
not been well driven in the first place.</p>

<p>A vital difficulty with timber structures generally is the
uncertainty that will commonly exist as to how far decay
extends in those cases where it has started. Timber does
not necessarily show upon its surface the evidences of internal
rotting. Memel timber may, indeed, be sometimes found
to have become thoroughly unreliable, yet showing no sign
of this upon its painted surface. By sounding the wood
with a hammer, or by probing, its condition may commonly
be ascertained. In cases of doubt, an auger-hole will make
it clear as to whether the interior be good or otherwise, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to the particular parts tested; but only as to those parts,
leaving it a matter of guesswork as to the remainder.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig85" id="Fig85"></a>
<img src="images/illo164a.png" alt="" width="550" height="186" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 85.</p>
</div>

<p>A railway bridge having many of the defects which have
been indicated may be quoted as an example. This structure
crossed a canal, supported upon piles, some of which were in
water, others carrying land spans. The canal span consisted
of four trusses, one under each rail, or nearly so, framed in
the manner shown in <a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>, precise details not, however,
being now available. The trusses, apart from deflection
under live load, sagged considerably&mdash;in one instance,
4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches; one inside truss was also leaning towards the
centre line of the bridge as much as 3 inches. One raker,
or diagonal strut, was rotted half through its thickness, and
many other timbers were badly decayed. The end connections
and joints were also in a bad condition. The vertical
tie-bolts of the main trusses were all slack. The piles
generally, many of which were badly decayed, had sunk and
inclined towards one end of the bridge about 4 inches in
7 feet of height, the ground being soft and unreliable.</p>

<p>Movement under a passenger train crawling over the
bridge was very appreciable, but not startling. There had
been introduced, from time to time, additional timbers and
iron ties, with the object of rendering the spans more reliable,
but leaving it somewhat difficult to determine the function
of the several members. The bridge was, of course, reconstructed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig86" id="Fig86"></a>
<img src="images/illo164b.png" alt="" width="550" height="182" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 86.</p>

<div class="figc550"><a name="Fig87" id="Fig87"></a><a name="Fig88" id="Fig88"></a>

<p class="caption_e"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 87. and <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 88.</p>
</div>

<p>An instance may here be cited showing how badly distorted
a timber structure may become without actually
falling. The bridge referred to consisted of three spans of
29 feet, each span having two trusses, between which ran
a colliery tramroad, 1-foot 6-inch gauge; the corves running
upon this, at 4 feet 6 inch centres, weighed, when full,
about 10 cwt. each. The trusses were badly out of shape,
the centre span having sagged 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, with one truss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the same span nearly 10 inches out of line at the centre.
This little bridge, of which some details are shown in <a href="#Fig86">Figs.
86</a>, <a href="#Fig87">87, and 88</a>, had been in use about twenty years.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig89" id="Fig89"></a>
<img src="images/illo166.png" alt="" width="600" height="212" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 89.</p>
</div>

<p>A third case which may be named is that of a road bridge,
about 12 feet wide, crossing by thirteen spans a shallow river
liable to floods. The construction was of a simple character,
as indicated in <a href="#Fig89">Fig. 89</a>, and consisted of piles supporting
trussed beams, which had sagged in some instances over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches. The bridge had, some years previous to the
author&#8217;s inspection, been heavily repaired, many new strut
and stretching pieces having been introduced, the piles also
being reinforced or renewed. Five years before, a traction
engine, said to weigh 5 tons, had passed across the bridge in
safety; but the author noticed that a coal wagon, which,
with the horse, weighed about 50 cwt., when walked slowly
over set up much movement. This bridge had been in use
nearly thirty years, and was very much out of line from end
to end.</p>

<p>Though timber bridges cannot at the best be considered
durable, yet, by attention to certain points in design and
construction, their length of life may be materially enhanced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Every cut across the grain may be considered an element of
weakness by exposing the material to quicker decay, for which
reason the number of ends, or of joints, should be reduced
to a minimum. An additional reason for reducing the
number of joints or other
connections is the liability
of these to develop movement,
as already stated, the
yield of any one joint, being
the cause of movement in
others, which might, but for
this, have remained close.
These considerations lead
to the conclusion that fewness
of parts is, in timber
construction, as in structural
work generally, an excellent
principle to observe. Mortising,
elaborate scarf joints,
recessing, or any cutting into
the timber which is not essential,
should be avoided, the
simplest forms of connection
being preferable, if at
all suitable. If a step or
butt surface is wanted for
any member, it is commonly
better to provide this by a
cleat or other added piece,
rather than by cutting into the timber butted against.</p>

<p>A complicated joint formed in the body of main timbers
can only be renewed by renewal of the timber itself, whereas
by the method indicated the joint is readily tightened, or
re-made, without involving the main member. Bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
surfaces should be ample, straps of liberal dimensions,
and bolts large (with good washers), both for the sake
of bearing surface in the holes, and reduction of any
liability to bend under cross-stress. In trusses of the
form shown in <a href="#Fig85">Figs. 85</a> and <a href="#Fig86">86</a>, it is desirable to introduce
diagonal members in the middle bay, even though it
may appear that the stiffness of the main beams is sufficient
to render this unnecessary as a matter of strength, as without
these there is apt to be, under rolling load, a slight
distortion, leading to working of the joints and free entry
of moisture. Lateral bracings should also, for much the
same reasons, be introduced, even though they may not
appear necessary in the new structure, with joints all close
and effective.</p>

<p>Projecting ends of timbers should be carried out well
beyond the requirement of strength or bearing, in order to
ensure a liberal margin for that decay in the end fibres which
commonly develops. Timbers resting upon abutments, or
running into confined spaces, should be arranged for free
ventilation and ready drying. Occasionally joints at the
lower ends of timbers are protected by lead or zinc flashings
to prevent water running into them, a method which should
have some protective value. Whatever measures may be
adopted, whether in the design or execution of timber bridge-work,
will, however, be but little effective, if the timber itself
is not good of its kind, and well seasoned.</p>

<p>Creosoting to be useful should be thorough and something
more than skin deep. The timber itself should be well dried
before treatment.</p>

<p>The repair of timber bridges very largely consists in the
renewal of decaying timbers, where this is practicable, or in
adding supplementary pieces where the old cannot conveniently
be displaced. Joints may be tightened up by
hard-wood wedges, properly secured to prevent slacking back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
all bolts being also screwed up tight, perhaps some additional
being introduced.</p>

<p>Piles standing in water, which have decayed, may be
strengthened by driving other piles between the old, or on
either side, but not of necessity opposite to them, and by
means of waling timbers bolted to the old piles, put in a
position to take load, either by the walings resting upon
their tops, or being bolted to them. Piles decayed where
entering solid ground may generally be strengthened by
bolting on supplementary timbers to reach well above and
below the decayed part, or by cutting out the bad length,
introducing a new piece, and fishing the butt-joints in a
proper manner. But all remedial measures have generally
to be considered with reference to cost, as compared with
the probable increase of life of the structure. With a bridge
in an advanced state of decrepitude, such repairs may prove
anything but economical, and at the best defer reconstruction
but a very moderate length of time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">MASONRY BRIDGES.</span></h2>

<p>Masonry bridges, in which description it is intended to
include structures both in stone and brick, are, when well
built, amongst the most durable and long-suffering of any
which come under the care of a maintenance engineer; yet
when developing the faults peculiar to their kind, they may
be the occasion of much anxiety, and render necessary frequent
inspection, or even continuous watching.</p>

<p>Apart from decay of mortar or material, defects may very
commonly be traced to the foundations, or to earth-slips.
Sinking, when uniform, may be quite harmless, though
possibly inconvenient; irregular sinking of piers or abutments
is quite a different matter. It is, however, remarkable
to what a degree sinking may be evident, without of necessity
rendering a structure unsafe. Movement of an amount and
kind which would be fatal to the connections of metallic
bridgework is endured by bridges of stone or brick; not, it
may be, without damage, yet with no occasion for alarm.
The superstructure of metallic bridges may often, however,
be restored to the true level before the mischief has become
serious, whereas in the case of masonry arches this is not
practicable.</p>

<p>Spreading of the abutments is very seldom the cause of
any great injury to an arch, though it is common enough to
find old and flat arches slightly down at the crown; but the
contrary case of abutments closing in is not very unusual
when these are high, or terminate a viaduct over a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
valley. Such an abutment may move during or soon after
construction, throwing up the crown of the end span affected;
or, if the arches are very solid and heavy, the abutment may
slide forward at the base, with no sensible reduction of the
opening.</p>

<p>When a viaduct connects the two ends of a high embankment,
it may happen that the end piers are not clear of the
embankment slope, in which event a pier may, should the
bank slip, move with it, as to that part not in solid ground;
with the result, in a bad case, that it is broken across and the
superstructure imperilled.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig90" id="Fig90"></a>
<img src="images/illo170.png" alt="" width="450" height="248" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 90.</p>
</div>

<p>A case of abutment movement is illustrated in <a href="#Fig90">Fig. 90</a>,
which represents the end arch of a masonry viaduct, one
abutment of which had moved forward in the manner
already referred to. From the springing upwards the arch
retained its form to within a short distance of the crown,
where it was forced up in the way indicated. When the
movement became pronounced, heavy timber centering was
introduced, with the object of preventing any mishap, the
damaged portions being ultimately cut out and made good.
The structure was thirty-five years old.</p>

<p>The practical utility of stop piers in long arched viaducts
is, perhaps, rather in checking movement of the tops of piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
under moving load than in arresting actual failure of a series
of arches. That the tops of piers do move very sensibly
need not be doubted. The author has attempted to measure
this in the case of piers about 60 feet to the springing, by
means of a theodolite placed below, but has reached no more
definite result than that a movement existed, of which he
was not able to determine the amount. If in a viaduct some
arches are more heavily loaded than others, each spreading
slightly, the end piers of the group will move amounts which
together equal the sum of the individual span spreads, with
a tendency in the arches beyond those of the group overloaded
to rise.</p>

<p>This rocking may be detrimental both to the piers and
arches, and helps to account for the disintegration of mortar
in arches and piers, which not infrequently happens. The
soffits will sometimes be seen with a thick incrustation of
lime, which has washed out of the joints, or from limestone
ballast above, where this has been in use. Arches of tall
viaducts may, indeed, become in so bad a condition that
pieces of stone or brick will drop out, necessitating repair at
heavy expense, of which scaffolding is commonly a large
part.</p>

<p>Tall piers may be found badly out of the upright due to
sinking of foundations. A marked case of this kind came
under the author&#8217;s notice&mdash;a viaduct of fifteen semicircular
arches, in which, though many piers were wanting in truth,
one in particular was about 1 foot 4 inches out of vertical,
making one side of the shaft plumb, and doubling the normal
batter of the other. Inquiry showed that in this instance
the pier had never been upright from its earliest history
dating back thirty-six years. This makes clear the desirability,
to avoid hasty conclusions, of ascertaining, when it is
possible to do so, the complete record of any structure.</p>

<p>A bridge fifty-eight years old, of three skew spans, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a railway over a canal, and having somewhat flat brick
arches with stone quoins upon low piers, developed the somewhat
unusual defect, as to the centre arch, of splitting along
its length for about 10 feet, parallel to and some 7 feet from
one face. In this case there was reason to believe that there
had been considerable local settlement of the piers on that
side of the bridge. The arches were otherwise in bad condition,
the brickwork poor, and the mortar decayed. Each
arch was down at the centre, and displayed a fault not
unusual where bad brickwork joins up to good cut stonework,
the quoins showing a tendency to separate from the
brick rings. Below the bridge were coal-workings.</p>

<p>Brick arches built in parallel rings sometimes separate
one ring from the other, demonstrating the known propriety
of bonding the rings together properly, and of carrying the
arch round, when building, at its full thickness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig91" id="Fig91"></a>
<img src="images/illo172.png" alt="" width="550" height="245" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 91.</p>
</div>

<p>An instance of bridge failure from a somewhat peculiar
cause may be quoted as of some interest, largely because the
structure was very ancient, having been in existence some
400 years. This bridge, carrying a road, was of the type
usual in old masonry bridges over a river, having small
arches, thick piers, and solid backings to the arches. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
flood-openings at one end had, by sinking and want of care,
become partly closed. The centre arch had, however, been
widened about 140 years previously. During a severe flood,
the swollen river, overflowing its banks, trespassed upon a
timber yard a little above bridge, and washed down into the
stream a large quantity of sawn timber; this, unable to get
through the main arch with freedom, compacted into a serious
obstruction. The flood water, thus checked in its passage,
seems to have scoured below the timber, and robbed the piers
of such support as they formerly had (see <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>). The
bridge stood in this condition till the water lowered, when
the middle part of the structure broke up, and subsided into
the hole which had been washed out. But for the monolithic
character of the old work it is probable the bridge would
have failed long before, as the gravel bed on which the piers
stood had been partly undermined
for very many years.
The case is instructive, as
showing how a slight accident&mdash;powerless
by itself
to work mischief&mdash;may be
very damaging when allied
with so powerful an agent
as running water.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig92" id="Fig92"></a>
<img src="images/illo173.png" alt="" width="300" height="351" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 92.</p>
</div>

<p>The enduring character
of even the roughest class
of masonry arch, if only
the material be good and
abutments stable, is shown
when it becomes necessary to destroy old work of this
character. <a href="#Fig92">Fig. 92</a> represents a short length of &#8220;cut and
cover&#8221; arching in process of demolition, just before it
fell in. The masonry was of hard sandstone rubble and
had been cut away, as shown, till at the point A only a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
small piece of the arch remained, when the length finally
broke up and dropped. Arches have commonly a great
reserve of strength; tunnel linings are, indeed, often badly
out of shape, closed in, and sunken; yet continue, with close
watching, and occasional repairs where the work has decayed
or bulged, to serve the purpose intended.</p>

<p>Though the equilibrium of masonry arches has been the
occasion of much profound study, and the nicest calculation
has sometimes been applied to the design of such work, yet
it appears that when an arch is well backed up, the theoretical
linear arch need have but little connection with the figure of
the intrados; a statement consonant both with common-sense
and the teachings of experience. With solid backing, this
would indeed seem to be more important than any part of
the arch ring below the top of the backing, the lower part
of the ring serving chiefly to preserve the face of the solid
work. Arches are frequently to be met with so out of their
true shape that but for the consideration named, failure
would seem to be inevitable. The masonry or brickwork
does not always show evidence of damage, if the distortion
has been slow; suggesting that structures of this kind have
a power of accommodation with which they are not generally
credited.</p>

<p>A noticeable cause of deterioration of masonry structures,
which may be quite independent of settlement, is serious
vibration. This is well known in connection with church
belfries, and is also locally apparent when telegraph or other
poles are attached to masonry parapets. Vibration, when
caused by heavy railway traffic, acting upon arches light or
originally bad, may demoralise the structure to such an extent
that repair becomes exceedingly difficult, because of the extensive
character of the mischief; but masonry bridges substantially
built, and particularly those carrying ordinary roads,
and not subject to much vibration, have great lasting powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
if repaired with skill, or even let alone. Distortion of the
arch may be quite consistent with practical stability, if the
movement or decay with which it originated is not progressive,
or has been arrested. In this connection a distinction
is to be made between arches well backed, to which the foregoing
remarks apply, and in which the two halves of each
arch may act as separate monoliths meeting at the crown, and
the case of a true arch ring independent of any outside resistance,
such as backing or spandrels may give, and depending
almost wholly upon the proper balance of its component
voussoirs for its stability. With the latter class of structure
no liberties may be taken; whilst with the former there is
seldom cause for fear, if the foundations do not give way,
and the work is dealt with judiciously, if at all. It must,
however, be understood that there are limits as to what
may be done effectively, short of rebuilding, in dealing with
structures in which, perhaps, brickwork is rotten and mortar
decayed and crumbling, the whole being little better than a
broken mass of rubbish.</p>

<p>In cases where it may be prudent to introduce safety
centring, as in an instance already referred to, it is commonly
expedient to refrain from causing this to take any sensible
part of the load till all movement has ceased, the centres
being at the outset largely precautionary. The requirement
with an arch in bad condition is to avoid disturbing it for
the worse. If the centres are wedged up whilst movement
is still going on, the effect may be to cause the arch to break
up upon the centring, and precipitate repair work which
might otherwise have been left to a more convenient time,
when all movement had stopped or been checked by suitable
measures. Viaduct arches in a bad condition, but not
necessitating the use of relief centres, are commonly dealt
with piecemeal by cutting out the bad places, a small part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
at a time, and making good. The work requires the greatest
care of experienced men.</p>

<p>Pointing masonry or brickwork is effective for little
other than protective purposes, and to check further weathering;
it has obviously no effect upon the interior work, and
if made to cover up the evidences of internal decay, is even
misleading and objectionable. In extreme cases it may be
desirable to open out the road and deal with the filling, to
relieve or to strengthen the outer spandrel walls, which sometimes
bulge, or for other purposes, as, for example, for rebuilding
inner spandrel walls, grouting up or otherwise
repairing solid backing, in which operations some regard
must be had to the effect of the work upon the balance of
the opposing halves of the arch.</p>

<p>Of the different classes of masonry commonly used in
bridgework, it may be well to remark that good coursed
rubble, or preferably that variety bonding both vertically
and horizontally, of a durable stone, perhaps quite unfit for
any but rough dressing, may make a most lasting structure,
the mortar, of course, being good. Each rough-dressed stone
presents a durable piece, fragments removed separate from
the block, probably along some line of relative weakness&mdash;there
is no &#8220;nursing&#8221; of weak corners; whereas with stones
reduced to a perfectly regular shape by chisel work, the
plane surfaces and geometrical angles are made with partial
regard only to the natural grain of the stone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">LIFE OF BRIDGES&mdash;RELATIVE MERITS.</span></h2>

<p>The life of bridges of differing materials has been incidentally
touched upon by the examples quoted, in dealing with
each class of structure. It will be useful to recapitulate
some of the facts adduced, and to compare the terms of life
so far as they appear to be indicated; but in doing this it is
necessary to remember that the life of a bridge of any one
material is inseparably connected with its own private history.
The duration of any such structure may be limited by adverse
conditions, peculiar to the case considered, by defects
of design, material, or workmanship&mdash;present from the first&mdash;or
by neglect, overloading, or accident, making up its later
record.</p>

<p>With the exception of timber structures, it is difficult to
find any class of bridges furnishing examples which have
reached the limit of life, independently of the evils named,
and as a result of unavoidable decrepitude. There are none
the less influences at work tending to this condition, and
which it is too much to expect can in all cases be foreseen or
completely guarded against, such as the shifting or scouring
of river-beds, settlement of foundations, natural decay, and
minor faults in design, which even in the most capable hands
may be expected ever to fall short of perfection. At the
best, then, the life of any structure, though long, must have
a limit. With bridges of more average or inferior qualities
the life may be positively short, even without the destructive
influence of overloading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Dealing with instances of metallic bridges, the adjacent
table gives the time each had been in existence when removed,
and some indication of the reason for its condemnation.
Those marked with an asterisk were cases of pronounced high
stress. From a study of the table it appears that in actual
practice, making no excuses of any sort, the length of life of
the wrought-iron bridges specified varied between twelve and
thirty-six years; but these figures applied to this collection
of cases only. It is to be remarked that many other bridges
outlasted these, and are likely to continue reliable. These
results show, then, no more than that some wrought-iron
bridges are short-lived, having, in fact, been selected as
examples of this. Longer-lived exceptions are useful, as
indicating that the durability of such structures is by no
means so limited as the table would suggest. It is to be
observed that, as design and maintenance are now better and
more generally understood than when experience was largely
wanting, it is to be expected that later examples will show
no such poor results.</p>

<p>Of steel bridges little can be said, because of the limited
time this material has been in use; but the generally acknowledged
belief, quite in agreement with the author&#8217;s observation,
that steel rusts more freely than wrought iron, suggests
that such bridges will have a shorter lease of life, the more
so that the surface-to-section ratio is also greater for higher
unit stresses, though other adverse influences are much the
same for one material as for the other.</p>

<p>Of cast-iron structures but few cases have been given; of
these, cast-iron arches have been noticed as developing defects
which led to reconstruction, or to limiting the loads to be
carried. Plain cast-iron girders, on the other hand, have
never, under the author&#8217;s direct observation, been removed
for any other reason than because they were cast iron, or
from over-stress, due to the growth of loads; never from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
defects or wasting, though it is not suggested no such cases
exist. The author has no evidence which points to what
may be the limit of life of a good cast-iron girder fairly
treated.</p>

<p>With timber bridges the length of life appears to be about
twenty-five years, but this is very largely dependent upon
the question of maintenance, and may range from fifteen to
thirty-five years. It is manifest that repairs, when extensive
and consisting of the renewal of the more essential parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the structure, border upon reconstruction, and may be continued
indefinitely. The length of life in ordinary cases,
and for the timbers commonly used in this country, may, for
railway bridges, be taken as stated, though for highway
bridges possibly longer.</p>

<p>Of masonry bridges little is to be said but that it is only
in cases of bad work or material&mdash;with, perhaps, vibration
or settlement&mdash;that these have a shortness of life comparable
with that of defective metallic bridges. Where these adverse
conditions obtain, heavy repairs may be necessary before the
structure is many years old; but, under reasonably fair conditions,
bridges of masonry may be expected to outlast structures
in any other material. Apart from road-bridges which
are admittedly long-lived, there are a large number of railway
bridges and viaducts of masonry which, despite heavy loads
and vibration, have been in use for the past seventy years.</p>

<p>Dealing with the cost of maintenance, this with bridges
of wrought iron or steel should result simply from scraping
and painting, with such other incidental work as may be
necessary on the subsidiary materials used in the structure.
The cost of painting will vary with the height and character
of the bridge, and the amount of scaffolding, if any, and
may be from 5<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. or more per square yard; this if
distributed over five years, a not unusual interval between
each painting, works out at an appreciable figure, which may
vary from one-third to one per cent. of the first cost, per
annum. The yearly cost of painting steel-work will, for
shorter intervals, come to a somewhat higher figure. Serious
occasional items of expense are those which should not be
necessary, repairs and possibly strengthening, which may
raise the total cost of maintenance very considerably.</p>

<p>Cast-iron bridges, being less liable to rust, cost less for
painting than other metallic bridges; and if the cast iron is
closed in by masonry, practically nothing; they do, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
involve very little expenditure in the maintenance. Not
being very amenable to repair or strengthening, cast-iron
bridges commonly remain very much as built, or are reconstructed.</p>

<p>The proper care of timber bridges may become costly as
the structure gains in age, and soon grow to a very wasteful
expenditure. This is evident when it is considered that
repairs may be necessary after ten years, and that whatever
may have been the cost of any part when new, it cannot be
replaced for the same amount, having regard to the labour
expended in removing the old member, and the special precautions
to be observed in dealing with an old structure
carrying its load. In addition to ordinary repairs, there will
be paint or other protective coating to be applied, though
this is not always done.</p>

<p>The upkeep charges of masonry bridges will be practically
nothing in favourable cases; but, on the other hand, where
extensive repairs become necessary, may reach a considerable
amount. Exceptional outlays are, however, infrequent, and
may be spread over a large number of years, in those rare
instances in which they become imperative.</p>

<p>For purposes of ready comparison, placing bridges of the
materials under review in order of durability, they would
appear as in column 1 of the table above; in order of low
maintenance charges, generally as in column 2; and in order
of low first cost, as in column 3. With respect to the question
of first cost, the arrangement of the third column applies
only to small bridges, say, up to 70-foot span; and, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
liable to variation with the conditions, is but approximately
correct. The less costly descriptions of masonry are alone
considered in this connection.</p>

<p>It may be added that the total yearly charge of interest
on first cost, redemption, and maintenance, appears to be for
masonry bridges, about one-half only of the corresponding
totals for bridges of wrought iron, steel, or timber; those of
cast iron taking an intermediate place.</p>

<p>Summarising the above considerations, and dealing with
the relative merits of bridges in the different materials, it
may be broadly stated that for conditions at all suitable
nothing seems to be superior to masonry&mdash;including in
this description first-class brickwork&mdash;whether for road or
railway bridges. One pronounced advantage of such bridges
with respect to length of life, is that they are but little
affected by increase of loads. The mass of a masonry arched
structure is so great, and the margin of strength commonly
so liberal, that considerable increments of load may have but
little effect upon the reliability of the structure.</p>

<p>Cast iron has, for bridges of simple design, a strong claim
to the second place, though its want of ductility is a demerit.
It can, however, have but a limited use in bridge construction,
being applicable only to small girder spans and skilfully-designed
arched structures.</p>

<p>For bridges of moderate span in which the question of
cost does not control the matter, wrought iron should probably
come next, steel being best reserved for those of a larger
size, in which weight of the structure greatly affects economy.</p>

<p>Timber may be regarded as a material rarely to be used
in this country for structures to occupy a permanent place,
unless for urgent economic reasons of the moment.</p>

<p>While expressing this general view of the matter, it is to
be admitted that the propriety of these conclusions is somewhat
discounted by the difficulty there now is in obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
cast iron of the desired toughness, or wrought iron with
promptitude and sufficient variety of section at a reasonable
price.</p>

<p>It is apparent, also, that the choice of material may be
largely influenced&mdash;even determined&mdash;by considerations of
headway, construction depth, or character of foundations; so
that no very definite rules can be usefully laid down, though
the adoption of unsuitable materials has not been so unusual
as to make these suggestions altogether purposeless.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="chaptitle">RECONSTRUCTION AND WIDENING&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>The need for the reconstruction of bridges, arising from
various causes which have been treated in the preceding
chapters, original weakness or faults in design, decay or defects,
may also be caused by such extraneous considerations as the
growth of loads, widening of the openings spanned, or improvement
of the headway.</p>

<p>In any case, a precise survey or measuring up of the
structure and its immediate surroundings is required, in the
execution of which the greatest care is desirable, and with
respect to which it may be well to give a few hints.</p>

<p>The surveying chain, when used, should be tested, the
measure of accuracy required rendering this imperative in a
degree peculiar to work of this class. Linen tapes should
also be compared with a reliable steel tape, and used only
where sufficiently accurate for the particular purpose. A
careful and observant man may do very good work with a
linen tape, making just that allowance in the sag of the tape
which corrects for the inevitable stretch; but there is still
some uncertainty involved in its use, and the author prefers
to rely upon a steel tape, notwithstanding the inconvenience
commonly experienced from its intractable nature and liability
to damage.</p>

<p>Instruments used must also be in the best adjustment;
as errors, which in ordinary field work may not be of great
importance, are inadmissible in bridge work.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter upon the methods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
small survey work, but it may be desirable to point out that
abutment walls should be plumbed for verticality; girders,
which are liable to be leaning, defined in position by reference
to their bearings; and generally that it should never be taken
for granted that there is truth in old work, or that this may
be assumed as to line or level.</p>

<p>In cases where disputes with any local authority as to
headway are likely to arise, it is prudent to supplement the
information as to level of soffits by rods cut to length in strict
agreement with the clear height, before removing the old
superstructure.</p>

<p>It is apparent that in cases where the superstructure is
already condemned, the detail measurements may be confined
to that part of the structure which is to remain, securing
only such information as to the work superseded which may
be required in arranging for the new work.</p>

<p>In taking particulars of skew bridges, needless as the
warning may seem, it is yet necessary to remark that there
may be right or left-hand skews which will not reverse.
The author has known a disregard of this to make serious
trouble in two instances.</p>

<p>Dealing first with reconstruction of the superstructure of
railway under-bridges, these, if small, may not give much
trouble, though the demand for greater strength will, perhaps,
involve some difficulty in working to the limiting construction
depth&mdash;i.e., the distance from the top of rail to soffit of
bridge&mdash;particularly as many old bridges have a very niggardly
allowance in this respect. It may be, and quite
commonly is, necessary to raise the rails a small amount, or,
if headway is not restricted, to lower the soffit. Clearances
between the running gauge and girder-work may also be
difficult to secure, more liberal allowances being now required
than formerly. Complications in the character of the permanent
way, so frequently found upon old bridges, should,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of course, be got rid of, if possible; but the endeavour may
introduce further difficulties. Regard must throughout be
had to the methods to be adopted in removing old work and
in erecting the new. Perhaps the simplest case to deal with
is that where girders lie parallel to, and under the rails, with
a timber floor upon which the permanent way is carried, as
sections of the road involving pairs of girders may be readily
removed, and replaced by the new girder-work (see <a href="#Fig93">Fig. 93</a>).
If the deck be of trough flooring or old rails, the matter may
not be so simple, as regard must then be had to the position
of joints in the existing floor, and the new work be schemed
with respect to the number and office of girders which may
be got in at any one breaking of the road. A slight slewing
of rails may sometimes be resorted to on occasion, where this
has the effect of releasing some part of the work not otherwise
to be dealt with.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig93" id="Fig93"></a><a name="Fig94" id="Fig94"></a>
<img src="images/illo186.png" alt="" width="450" height="325" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 93 and 94.</p>
</div>

<p>Bridges having main girders, with timber or trough flooring
resting upon the bottom flanges, or suspended by bolts,
will, if carrying many roads, cause some little difficulty, as
the dismantling of any one span involves the disturbance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
others; where, however, many lines are concerned, it may
be feasible to put one or more temporarily out of use, preserving
the continuity of traffic over those which remain,
but refraining from any diversion of the more important
roads.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar troubles occur where main girders with
cross-girders at the lower flanges are found, particularly if
the cross-girders are arranged in line, the ends abutting on
each side of the same main girder webs. It is seldom, however,
that this construction is used in bridges of small span
carrying many roads; but where it does occur, it may necessitate
the use of timbering below, to carry the ends of cross-girders
when freed from their supporting main girders.
(See <a href="#Fig94">Fig. 94</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig95" id="Fig95"></a>
<img src="images/illo187.png" alt="" width="500" height="109" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 95.</p>
</div>

<p>If it is proposed to use new main and cross-girders, it is
desirable to arrange these in the manner already recommended,
the cross-girders not in line; this has peculiar advantages in
reconstruction work, as the bolting up and riveting of the
cross-girder ends is not hampered by other cross-girder
attachments, leaving each piece of floor complete in itself.
Twin main girders are occasionally used with the same object,
and present the advantage of simplicity in erection and independence
of one span from those adjoining (see <a href="#Fig95">Fig. 95</a>);
but the method is wasteful of space, and involves a somewhat
greater total weight in the main girders.</p>

<p>The foregoing observations apply more generally to small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
single-span bridges, the operations on which may be effected
without any material disturbance of traffic arrangements;
though this can seldom be wholly avoided, it should be confined,
where practicable, to a few hours on a Sunday.</p>

<p>The reconstruction of bridges over 70-feet span may have
to be dealt with under more elaborate arrangements, if carrying
two lines only, possibly with single-line working for a
period more or less protracted; or it may be necessary, having
regard to the weight of main girders to be removed, to carry
the whole structure upon temporary staging, supporting the
road independently, cutting up and removing the old work,
and later putting the new work in place, either by detailed
erection in its ultimate position, or by erection at one side
and drawing across. The latter method is, however, commonly
reserved for cases in which no special staging is used
under the old structure.</p>

<p>Bridges of a number of openings are usually dealt with
by securing full possession of one road at a time, which for
double-line bridges necessitates single-line working. It is
commonly out of the question, even with moderate spans,
to deal with some of these only at a time, and so avoid continuous
possession of one road, for a lengthened period; and
it can only, as a rule, be managed where the ends of the new
main girders do not in any way interfere with those of the
old, and where it is not necessary to reset bed-stones, or make
other alterations in the bearings which necessitate the complete
clearance of the pier-tops. In exceptional cases it may
be found possible to arrange for the complete removal of a
small number of moderate spans on a Sunday, and the putting
in place of the new work, as in the case of small single spans.</p>

<p>Spans erected to one side of the final position, to be later
travelled across, are commonly mounted upon gantry staging,
and up to 50 tons weight may rest directly upon rails well
greased. The power adopted to move the span is usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that of screw or hydraulic jacks, or occasionally engine haulage,
special tackle being in that case necessary to apply the
engine power in the right direction. If the time is limited,
or weight considerable, a more elaborate arrangement by
which the load is supported upon wheels, may be necessary,
with a view to reducing the resistance to a manageable
amount. All work which it is possible to do before shifting
into place, including the permanent way, where this is of a
special character, should be executed in advance, leaving only
the rail connections to be made good when the span is in
position.</p>

<p>Where timber staging is used to carry the permanent
way before dismantling an old structure, it is convenient to
begin by placing stout balks of timber under the sleepers
from end to end of the bridge, or directly under the rails if
space is limited; the staging is then arranged to give support
to the running timbers.</p>

<p>Metallic under-bridges of ample headway, perhaps over
coal-workings (since settled down), or for some less sufficient
reason made of metal, may be cheaply replaced by brick
arches built below the old superstructure, the springings of
the arch being checked into the face of the existing abutments.
With stout walls, careful work and good material will make
this an efficient and durable job.</p>

<p>It being a primary condition of reconstruction work to
interfere but little with ordinary traffic arrangements, single-line
working is avoided wherever practicable; as this, always
objectionable, may necessitate the erection of special signals
and signal apparatus, besides the temporary remodelling of
the roads, and in this country may involve also a Board of
Trade inspection&mdash;altogether a troublesome and expensive
business.</p>

<p>Any bridgework which is accompanied by breaking or
blocking the road can only be undertaken by arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with the traffic department, after notice duly given and
published in the periodical record of such matters; it is
generally fixed for a Sunday. Preparatory to this, it is
necessary to make all ready by getting as much done beforehand
as is possible. Wherever practicable and prudent, the
whole work is released from its surroundings, masonry cut
away, rivets cut out and replaced by good bolts, nuts removed
from holding down bolts, or the bolts cut through, etc.
Particular care should be exercised to ascertain what remains
to be done immediately prior to removal. It is necessary
further to arrange for trucks to be in readiness to receive old
material, and others containing new girder work to be conveniently
stationed, having been loaded up to come right end
foremost; engine power, cranes, empty and loaded trucks,
being all marshalled and so placed as to be available in proper
order, and as wanted. There must be no mistake as to what
roads will be fouled by swinging the crane with its load, or
as to the reach of the crane in effecting its work.</p>

<p>The whole operation to be conducted on any Sunday
should be well within the resources of the men and plant
engaged in it, or so managed that it is a matter of no serious
importance if the whole cannot be completed as originally
desired.</p>

<p>Possession of the roads to be blocked having been secured
between certain hours, if some part only of the work to be
carried out has been completed as the time grows short, any
attempt to execute the remainder may result in checking
trains until such time as the line may be reported clear&mdash;a
contingency to be avoided&mdash;though the temptation to save
another Sunday&#8217;s work by delay of a few minutes to some
one train may be considerable.</p>

<p>In scheming any reconstruction, it may be insisted that
at least one feasible method of carrying out the work must
be secured, though it is the author&#8217;s experience that frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
some other method than that contemplated is in the end
adopted, when, some months later, the final arrangements
for fixing are made. The tendency of a zealous erector is
commonly to take full advantage of any facilities offered,
with a view to a moderate amount of work being done at any
one time, and to achieve as much more as he can himself
secure by scheming, or a liberal use of labour; all Sunday
work, with attendance of engines and cranes, being of necessity
expensive.</p>

<p>Railway over-bridges do not commonly present any
particular difficulties. The spans to be dealt with are
usually small, and the weights to be lifted moderate. The
height above rails may, however, be above the lift of any
crane; and, for the purpose of raising main girders, a derrick
may become necessary, the rearing and guying of which may
block many roads during the time it is in use. The girders
of larger spans, too unmanageable to be lifted whole, may
be erected upon staging; to secure the requisite headway
it may be necessary to build the girders at a level above
that at which they will finally be, lowering them into
position when self-supporting, and after the removal of the
staging.</p>

<p>The widening of railway under-bridges is, as a rule, a
matter of no special difficulty, but some remarks may be of
use. Widenings should be planned with a regard to later
reconstruction of the original bridge, if that is at all likely
to be necessary, and with the object that, when complete,
the whole should be a consistent piece of work.</p>

<p>It may, indeed, happen that widening of a bridge may
involve the remodelling or reconstruction of the old work,
to enable the new roads to be laid down as desired; this is
more likely to be necessary where there exist main girders
not competent to take any additional load, and to duplicate
which would sacrifice space between the new and old roads;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
or it may be unavoidable because of slewing of the old rails,
as part of a general rearrangement.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig96" id="Fig96"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 96.</p>
</div>

<p>Dealing with widenings simply, there is often some little
trouble in contriving a connection between the new and the
old work, as this may have to be made under, or close to, the
sleeper ends of the existing roads. It is desirable to arrange
this part so that no drilling of old work for rivets or bolts
shall be necessary, there being, in fact, no strict connection.
By judicious scheming, this may be effected, whilst securing
freedom from leakage of water at the joint. (See <a href="#Fig96">Figs. 96</a>
and <a href="#Fig97">97</a>.) If tying of the new and old structure is desired,
this can usually be done quite simply, well below the floor at
some more accessible level.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig97" id="Fig97"></a><a name="Fig98" id="Fig98"></a>
<img src="images/illo193.png" alt="" width="350" height="453" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 97 and 98.</p>
</div>

<p>The strict jointing-up of trough flooring, new to old, at
right angles to the troughs, cannot be contemplated, but may
be dealt with by treating each part independently, the ends
being near together, separated by the space of an inch or so.
Each trough end being closed up by a diaphragm or oak
block to prevent ballast dropping through, the top of the
space may be covered by a loose strip, secured to prevent it
shifting, the bottom provided with a gutter of liberal dimensions
to take away leakage, as it is practically impossible to
make this arrangement &#8220;drop dry&#8221; under the conditions
common in executing work of this kind (see <a href="#Fig98">Fig. 98</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig99" id="Fig99"></a><a name="Fig100" id="Fig100"></a>
<img src="images/illo194.png" alt="" width="350" height="375" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 99 and 100.</p>
</div>

<p>Where trough flooring, new and old, has to be made good
parallel to the troughs, the difficulty of making a direct connection
is less marked, and it is not unusual to introduce a
strip cover simply; but if accessible, the work is still troublesome,
as there is commonly a want of strict alignment and
truth as to level, between the new and the old troughs. It
is preferable to arrange for junctions of a more convenient
type, as in <a href="#Fig99">Figs. 99 and 100</a>.</p>

<p>When widening masonry arch bridges by girder-work, it
is desirable to insure that any girders parallel to the masonry
face shall be sufficiently far removed from it to enable painting
to be executed. The space remaining between the girder
and the arch may then be bridged by floor-plates, or an extension
of the timber floor if that is adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig101" id="Fig101"></a><a name="Fig102" id="Fig102"></a>
<img src="images/illo195.png" alt="" width="350" height="529" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 101 and 102.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig103" id="Fig103"></a>
<img src="images/illo196.png" alt="" width="300" height="289" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 103.</p>
</div>

<p>In effecting a junction such as this, the author has used
the arrangement shown in <a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a>, the advantage being
that the piece of connecting-floor is sufficiently wide, and
also sufficiently flexible, to allow the girder-work freedom to
deflect without doing harm. The load carried by the width
of floor is, as to one part, delivered well on to the old
masonry, in preference to being imposed near to the face.
If it should for any reason be imperative to place the girder
close to the arch face, it is preferable to scheme the floor so
that there shall be no actual contact, the new floor in that
case slightly overhanging the masonry, as in <a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a>, or
dealt with as in <a href="#Fig103">Fig. 103</a>, if depth is restricted.</p>

<p>The widening of masonry arch bridges by masonry, calls
for no other remark than that the new work should be free
from the old; though it may be advisable, when the widening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
is narrow, to tie the new work to the old in such a way as
to permit independent settlement.</p>

<p>If the widening is exceptionally narrow, there may be
no choice but to bond the new and old work together, and
in the best manner, with the object of minimising the risk
of separation.</p>

<p>The above matters relative to widenings, though apparently
trifling, may by neglect cause much trouble and expense
in maintenance. They principally concern small bridges,
the extension of larger structures coming rather in the category
of independent works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h3>

<p>In bringing these chapters, dealing largely with questions
affecting maintenance, to a close, it may be well to draw
attention to the fact that economy in design (apart from
improper reduction of sections) goes hand-in-hand with
economy of upkeep. Given good material, that which favours
low first cost, simplicity of detail, fewness of parts, absence
of smithing, the use of rolled sections, and good depth to
girders, favours also small expenditure in maintenance.
The less complex the design, the easier will it be to keep the
structure in order; the less the number of parts, the fewer
will be the connections. Freedom from smithing eliminates
liability to failure at cranks, or other work which has been
subject to fire. It is apparent also that the free use of rolled
instead of built-up sections, reduces the liability to trouble
from bad riveting, or from good riveting overstressed. A
liberal depth to all girders, by reducing deflections, limits the
inclination of the ends and gives the connections a better
chance of remaining intact. Lastly, with work of this
character, the labour of scraping and painting is simplified
and cheapened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The author wishes to reiterate the statement made in
the opening paragraphs of this book, that all instances of
decrepitude, failure, or peculiar behaviour cited, have been
under his direct observation. The fact is insisted upon
simply that the reader may appreciate that the information
is at first hand.</p>

<p>It has not been thought necessary, nor was it considered
desirable, to indicate the locality of each case referred to;
but it may be said that the matter of these chapters has been
accumulating during many years, and relates to structures
under the control of many different bodies.</p>

<p>The study of old bridges is strongly recommended,
particularly with respect to stress and strain, which in structures
new or old, occur possibly as may be expected&mdash;certainly
as they must. Consideration of existing work may thus be a
useful check upon the fanciful requirements of some methods
of design. There is a recent tendency, for instance, in English
practice to over-stiffen the webs of plate-girders, such that if
the theory upon which the results are based were true, many
old bridges carrying their loads with no sign of distress, should
have failed long ago. Excess in riveting is a common extravagance,
to which the same criticism may in a less degree
apply. Considerable impact allowances for girders of large
span may also be referred to as an application of empiric
theory not justified by experience, which, as in all cases
where such considerations fight with facts, should be modified
or rejected.</p>
